-- FOCCPing, the B0 spike's SFSE plugin, as an xmake project in the shape of libxse/commonlibsf-template.
-- lib/commonlibsf is the libxse CommonLibSF checkout (pinned in build.ps1: 9d090c4, with its submodule
-- lib/commonlib-shared at 9fbb74d). build.ps1 builds from a copy of this folder in the staging folder and places the
-- checkout there as a directory junction, so nothing of the library is in the repo. The commonlibsf.plugin rule writes
-- the SFSE version data (the library's res/commonlibsf-plugin.cpp.in): the Address Library (SFSE's AddressLibraryV2
-- bit, the one SFSE 0.2.21 counts as address independence), the 1.14.70+ layout, CompatibleVersions RUNTIME_LATEST.
-- Nothing in src/ redeclares it.
