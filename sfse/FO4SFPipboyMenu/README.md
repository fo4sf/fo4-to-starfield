# FO4SFPipboyMenu: Pip-Boy step 1 probe (FAL-187)

One question: **can a plugin of ours register a menu of its own and show a movie of its own** on Starfield
1.16.244.0? The plugin registers one named menu, `FO4SF_PipboyMenu`, opens it on one key, closes it on the same key,
and logs every step. The stage is picked by `Stage` in `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini`:

- **(a)** `Stage=1`: the menu with no movie.
- **(b)** `Stage=2`: the same menu showing `Interface/FO4SF_PipboyMenu.swf`, a filled green rectangle with a
  dot-matrix label, from `FO4SFPipboyProbe - Main.ba2`.

- **(c)** `Stage=3` (FAL-216): (b) with the data channel. The movie (staged with `--channel`) has a text field and a
  button; the plugin writes the player's position into the field while the menu is open, hears the button's click, and
  logs the pause state and who holds input. Section "Stage (c): the data channel".
- **(d)** `Stage=4` (FAL-272): the STAT page, the first page the owner uses by hand. The movie (staged with `--page`)
  has a title, a tab line, seven lines and two buttons; the plugin fills the lines twice a second with the player's
  health, level and experience, carry weight, `FO4SF_Rads`, cell, worldspace and game time (tab 1, STATUS) or with
  live data (tab 2, DATA). NEXT TAB switches the tab, CLOSE closes the menu. Section "Stage (d): the STAT page"; the
  owner's card is `docs/spikes/pipboy-stat-page-owner-card.md`.
- **(e)** `Stage=5` (FAL-301): the page kit. One movie for every page (staged with `--kit`): main tabs, sub-tabs, a
  scrolling list with a selection bar, value rows, a footer and key hints. The pages are data: sections of this
  plugin's ini. Keys and clicks move between them. Section "Stage (e): the page kit"; the owner's card is
  `docs/spikes/pipboy-page-kit-owner-card.md`.

`Stage=0` (as shipped) logs one line and does nothing else.

| File | What |

| `src/main.cpp` | the plugin: version guard, checks before use, the menu object, the key thread |
| `src/pch.h` | precompiled header (libxse's game headers and SFSE layer) |
| `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini` | `Stage`, `Key` (default `0x79`, F10), `Flags` (0), `KeepAlive` (1); stage (b): `Movie` (empty: ours, FAL-614), `CodeObj` (0), `CodeObjNames` (empty: `PlaySound,HideMenu`), `CodeObjHide` (0), `CodeObjSound` (0), `CodeObjInit` (empty), `CodeObjProbe` (empty), `CodeObjCalls` (empty), `CodeObjAt` (empty), `CodeObjPages` (0) and `ShellKeys` (empty); stage (c): `FlagSets` (`0x0,0x8,0x9`), `SnapshotKey` (`0x7A`, F11), `ClickCall` (empty: off); stages (d) and (e): `PageFlagSets` (`0x19`); stages (d), (e): `CancelCode1` to `CancelCode4` (`0x1B`, `0x09`: Esc and Tab as Windows virtual-key codes, as the PC's game run logged them); stage (e): `KitUp` to `KitNextTab`, and the pages (`[Kit]`, `[Page <TAB>/<SUB>]`) |
| `xmake.lua`, `build.ps1` | the PC build: FOCCPing's build path (`docs/spikes/combined-core-probes.md`, B0-2) |

| `scripts/ui/make_pipboy_kit.py` | the page kit (stage (e)): reads and checks the pages of the ini (`--check`) and writes the kit's movie for them (pure Python, on `make_probe_swf.py`; tests `tests/test_pipboy_kit.py`) |
| `scripts/ui/pipboy_quest_bytes.py` | reads two F11 dumps of the mission (`step=kit_quest_bytes`) from the log and lists the words that differ, to find the current stage, and prints its `MissionStageAt=` line (FAL-446, FAL-527); with `--objective <n>`, the bytes that differ behind the mission's pointers (`step=kit_quest_obj`) and the `MissionObjective=` line (FAL-571; test `tests/test_pipboy_quest_bytes.py`) |
| `scripts/ui/pipboy_map_bytes.py` | reads two F11 dumps of the player (`step=kit_map_bytes`, `step=kit_map_cell`) from the log: the angle float that turned by about 90° and its `HeadingAt=` line; with `--grid`, whether the cell's own grid follows POSITION over 4096 and its `GridUnits=` line (FAL-595; test `tests/test_pipboy_map_bytes.py`) |
| `scripts/ui/make_pipboy_probe.py` | stages the empty `FO4SFPipboyProbe.esm` and the movie (`--channel`, `--page` or `--kit`); `check` checks the plugin |

## Design: the engine's menu object, not libxse's IMenu class

The plugin is built on libxse/commonlibsf `9d090c4` for SFSE, the Address Library, the logger, `UI::RegisterMenu`,
`UI::IsMenuOpen`, `UIMessageQueue::AddMessage` and `BSFixedString`. It does **not** use libxse's `IMenu` class: every
`IMenu` virtual there is `REL::ID{ 0 }`, and a lookup of id 0 stops the game. Instead the menu object is the engine's
own: memory of ours, the engine's IMenu constructor, then a copy of the engine's primary IMenu vtable with only our
slots replaced. The two other vtables stay the engine's, as the constructor set them.

The slot before the copy holds the engine's RTTI complete object locator for IMenu, read from the slot before the
engine's primary vtable (the one `step=rtti vtable=primary` checks). MSVC's `dynamic_cast` reads the locator there,
and the engine casts a shown menu from `IMenu` to `GameMenuBase`. Our object is a plain IMenu, so that cast returns
null. The shipped movie-less menu of a public precedent gets null there too: its menu carries its plugin's own RTTI,
and MSVC's cast compares type descriptors by decorated name (`.?AVGameMenuBase@RE@@` is not the game's
`.?AVGameMenuBase@@`). The engine accepts that null: at `782f944a` both stages passed in the game as a plain IMenu,
ten toggles each with `match=yes`, and at (b) our movie drawn (owner PC, 10 Nov, 20:02 and 20:06 UTC). The run at
`b3f352b7` had no locator in that slot: the cast read whatever global lay before the copy, and the game hung right
after the show message (PC hang dump, 10 Nov). A `GameMenuBase` build exists in history only (`d750f393`, never built
or run).

With the constructor's own flags (`Flags=0`) the open menu neither pauses the game nor takes its input: the HUD stays
and the game runs behind it (the same run). Stage (c) records what other flags do.

| Slot | Ours |
| --- | --- |
| 0x00 | destructor wrapper: the engine's destructor without its delete, then our `free` |
| 0x03, 0x04 | `GetName` (`FO4SF_PipboyMenu`), `GetRootPath` (`""`: our movie has no code to bind) |
| 0x05 | `GetViewScaleMode`: ShowAll |
| 0x06 | `LoadMovie`: (a) returns true with no movie; (b) the engine's, logged, with the event dispatcher off |
| 0x08 | `ProcessMessage`: the engine's, logged; at (a) our own answer to show; at (c) the data channel, at (d) the page and at (e) the kit, after the engine's handling |
| 0x0A | (a) only: `IsMovieLoaded` true |

## Game version and where every id comes from

**Accepted runtime: 1.16.244.0 only.** Any other runtime logs `refuse step=version` and the plugin stays idle, as
FO4SFBorder does. The Address Library file `versionlib-1-16-244-0.bin` (format 5) is read by the plugin itself from
its own folder before anything else. Every id must be below the file's count, non-zero, and inside Starfield.exe's
image, and libxse's own lookup must return the same offset.

| Name | Id | Source | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UI.Singleton | 937580 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| UI.RegisterMenu | 130463 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| UI.IsMenuOpen | 130475 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| UIMessageQueue.Singleton | 937897 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| UIMessageQueue.AddMessage | 130659 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| BSStringPool.GetEntry | 1186742 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| BSStringPool.Entry.Release | 139340 | libxse | file + libxse lookup |
| IMenu vtable, primary | 475515 | libxse `VTABLE_IMenu[2]` | RTTI: locator offset 0, type `.?AVIMenu@@` |
| IMenu vtable, BSInputEventUser | 475517 | libxse `VTABLE_IMenu[1]` | RTTI: offset 0x10 (10 slots) |
| IMenu vtable, BSTEventSink | 475519 | libxse `VTABLE_IMenu[0]` | RTTI: offset 0x50 (2 slots) |
| IMenu RTTI type descriptor | 844868 | libxse `RTTI_IMenu` | the three locators point at it |
| IMenu constructor | 130615 | a public precedent | its first 0x200 bytes load the primary vtable |
| IMenu scalar deleting destructor | 130616 | a public precedent | primary vtable slot 0x00 |
| IMenu::LoadMovie | 130618 | a public precedent | slot 0x06, and equal to SFSE 0.2.21's own hook address `0x2551AB0` |
| IMenu::ProcessMessage | 130624 | a public precedent | slot 0x08 |
| IMenu::IsMovieLoaded | 130619 | a public precedent | slot 0x0A |

libxse's `VTABLE_IMenu` array is `{ 475519, 475517, 475515 }`, not in subobject order. Read on the PC from the
1.16.244.0 executable (FAL-187, 10 Nov): 475519 at rva `0x4d7e938` has locator offset 0x50, 475517 at rva `0x4d7e950`
has 0x10. The first stage (a) run, with the two swapped, stopped at `refuse step=rtti vtable=BSInputEventUser ...
offset=0x50 expected_offset=0x10` before any registration.

Any mismatch logs one `refuse step=<step>` line and the plugin stays idle: no registration, no call into the game.

## Stage (c): the data channel (FAL-216)

The base under the Pip-Boy's pages: native code writes into our movie, and our movie calls native code. Nothing in
the movie is code (`make_probe_swf.py --channel`): the root holds two named children, a one-line text field
`fo4sfPosition` with its own embedded 5 x 7 font (`FO4SFDot`, so no game font is needed) and a button sprite
`fo4sfButton` labelled CLICK. The plugin does all of it from our `ProcessMessage`, after the engine's own handling, on
the engine's thread for this menu:

- **kShow:** the movie's ActionScript 3 root (`GetVariable("root")`), then `getChildByName("fo4sfButton")`, then our
  function (`CreateFunction` with our `FunctionHandler`) added as its `"click"` listener (`addEventListener`). Once per
  movie. Our handler logs `step=click n=<k>`; it is a static object whose count Scaleform raises and lowers but never
  takes to zero.
- **kShow and every kUpdate:** the player's position (the `PlayerCharacter` singleton, `TESObjectREFR::data.location`)
  as `X <x> Y <y> Z <z> CLICKS <k>` into the field's `text`, then read back: `step=field ... set=1 read_back=1
  match=yes`. The key thread sends one kUpdate every 500 ms while the menu is open (only after `IsMenuOpen` on the
  main thread says so), so the field follows the player while the menu is open.
- **Pause and input:** `step=snapshot tag=<t> paused=<Main::isGameMenuPaused> menus=<n>[name,...]
  contexts=<n>[id,...]`: the open menus among a short list of names, and ControlMap's active input contexts in stored
  order. Tags: `show`, `open` (every tenth update), `hide` (on the menu's thread), `main_after_open` and
  `main_after_close` (main thread, 750 ms after each toggle), and `key` (main thread, on `SnapshotKey`, F11).
  `menus=` asks the engine's own `IsMenuRegistered` and `IsMenuOpen` (the calls `Register` and `Toggle` make) about
  each name, on the main thread only; on the menu's thread it is `-`. The first such snapshot logs `step=menu_names
  registered=... not_registered=...`: only `Console` is a name libxse states, the others are guesses. (At `e7925e00`
  it read libxse's `UI::menuStack` at +0x3F0, which gave `menus=0[]` in every snapshot, in the game's own pause menu
  too: that offset is wrong for 1.16.244, so the read is gone.)
- **Flag sets:** open k gets the constructor's flags OR `Flags` OR entry `(k - 1) mod n` of `FlagSets`, at creation and
  again at kShow (`step=flags show=<k> set=<i> had=<f> now=<f>`). Shipped: `0x0` (the constructor's own), `0x8`
  (libxse's `ShowCursor`, bit 3) and `0x9` (bit 3 and bit 0; bit 0 is Fallout 4's "pauses game", unverified in
  Starfield). The snapshot's `paused=` and `menus=` show what each set does.

**Checked first, at stages (c) to (e) only** (stages (a) and (b) check exactly their 16 ids, as before). Sixteen
more ids, each in the file, non-zero, inside the image and equal through libxse; then `step=channel_ids`. These
thirteen, and the three of the click's section below:

| Name | Id | Source | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main.Singleton | 883591 | libxse | file + libxse; the object's RTTI before the first read |
| PlayerCharacter.Singleton | 922868 | libxse | file + libxse; the object's RTTI before the first read |
| ControlMap.Singleton | 938003 | libxse | file + libxse; the object's RTTI before the first read |
| Main, PlayerCharacter, ControlMap RTTI | 859948, 860819, 867481 | libxse | the type descriptor's name (`.?AV` or `.?AU` + `Main@@`, `PlayerCharacter@@`, `ControlMap@@`) |
| GFx MovieImpl, GFx AS3 MovieRoot RTTI | 841612, 842209 | libxse | the type descriptor's name (`MovieImpl@GFx@Scaleform@@`, `MovieRoot@AS3@GFx@Scaleform@@`) |
| GFx Value ObjectAddRef, ObjectRelease, GetMember, SetMember, Invoke | 169745, 169746, 169748, 169749, 169750 | libxse | each equal to SFSE 0.2.21's own 1.16.244 address (`sfse/ScaleformValue.h` at 48535cc: `0x3352400`, `0x33524A0`, `0x33528A0`, `0x3352C90`, `0x33530B0`) |

Before first use: `Main`, `PlayerCharacter` and `ControlMap` are their types by RTTI at offset 0 (`step=object`), and
the pointer at movie + 0x18 is a `GFx::AS3::MovieRoot` by RTTI whose slots 0x30 (`CreateFunction`) and 0x32
(`GetVariable`) are inside the image (`step=movie_root`; libxse and SFSE 0.2.21 declare both at those slots). The
movie's own type is logged. The input contexts, the pause byte and the position are layouts only libxse states; their
reads are guarded, so a wrong offset logs `fault` or a wrong number, not a crash.

**Not verified until the session:** that `getChildByName` finds timeline children of a movie with no code; that the
embedded font draws; that our menu gets the mouse (the flag sets test it); that kUpdate reaches an open menu of ours;
what `isGameMenuPaused` and the context ids mean (the controls below settle it).

### Stage (c) with `ClickCall`: a click reaches a quest (FAL-246, B0-3)

The bridge FOCCPing tests (B0-2) runs from script to native. The Pip-Boy, the perk and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. screens,
lockpicking and a C.A.M.P. menu need the other direction: a click causes a script action. With
`ClickCall=<script>.<function>` (shipped empty: off), each `step=click` also queues, on the main thread through SFSE's
task interface, one call of that global Papyrus function through the script VM's `DispatchStaticCall` (libxse's
`IVirtualMachine` slot 0x2F). The session uses `ClickCall=FOCC_B0.Click`: the combined probe kit's B0 script resolves
its probe quest (`FOCC_Probe.Q`) and logs `b0 click` in `focc.0.log` through that quest's `Trace`.

Three more ids, checked like the others at stage (c) (in the file, non-zero, inside the image, equal through libxse,
the RTTI ids by name in `step=channel_ids`); they are FOCCPing's:

| Name | Id | Source | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GameVM.Singleton | 937585 | libxse | file + libxse; the object's RTTI (`GameVM`, offset 0) before the first read |
| GameVM, BSScript.Internal.VirtualMachine RTTI | 865426, 870795 | libxse | the type descriptor's name (`GameVM@@`, `VirtualMachine@Internal@BSScript@@`) |

Before the first call: the VM the GameVM holds (libxse `GameVM::impl`, +0xE0, a guarded read) is a
`BSScript::Internal::VirtualMachine` by RTTI at offset 0 (`IVirtualMachine` is its first base), and its vtable's
slots 0x00 to 0x2F are inside the image (`step=object name=VirtualMachine ... dispatch_static_call=<rva>`). Then each
click logs `step=dispatch n=<k> call=FOCC_B0.Click queued=<0|1>`.

**No arguments, no callback.** Arguments go into a `BSScrapArray` the VM hands over; growing it calls
`ScrapHeap::Allocate`, which libxse 9d090c4 states as `REL::ID{ 0 }` (a lookup of id 0 stops the game). So the
argument function returns true and never touches the array; the function's own line carries the evidence. The
callback is a null functor, as the two public precedents that call `DispatchStaticCall` on libxse pass it (a web-view
UI framework and a co-op mod). Passing values (which item was clicked) needs the scrap heap's ids first: the next step.

**Not verified until the session:** that slot 0x2F is `DispatchStaticCall` on 1.16.244 (libxse's declaration; the
precedent fork's agrees, but it is the same library's lineage, and SFSE 0.2.21 declares no VM vtable). A wrong slot
can stop the game at the first click, so the session card runs this last, in a launch of its own. Also open: whether
the VM runs the call while our menu is open or only after it closes (the card's 10-second hold reads it from the two
logs' clocks), and that the queued call needs no other thread than the main one.

## Stage (d): the STAT page (FAL-272)

The first page the owner uses by hand, on the channel test C proved at `e7925e00` (text in, click out at flag set
`0x9`). The movie (`make_probe_swf.py --page`, no code, under the same name `Interface/FO4SF_PipboyMenu.swf`) is a
green panel of 70 % x 76 % of the screen with the title `FO4SF PIP-BOY  STAT`, a tab line `fo4sfTab`, seven lines
`fo4sfLine0` to `fo4sfLine6`, the hint `F10 OPENS AND CLOSES THIS PAGE` and two buttons the size of test C's CLICK:
`fo4sfTabButton` (NEXT TAB) and `fo4sfCloseButton` (CLOSE). Its embedded font is the 5 x 7 table plus `' , ( ) ? ! + %
& _ # =`; the plugin writes upper case and turns any other character into `?`, at most 54 to a line.

| Tab | Lines |
| --- | --- |
| 1 STATUS | `HEALTH <n>`; `LEVEL <n>   XP <n>`; `CARRY WEIGHT MAX <n>`; `RADS <n>` or `RADS NOT INSTALLED`; `CELL <name> (<form id>)`; `WORLD <name> (<form id>)` or `WORLD NONE (INTERIOR)` (FAL-595: the worldspace at `+0x110`, 0 indoors); `TIME <hh:mm>   DAY <n>` |
| 2 DATA | `POSITION X Y Z`; `UPDATES <n>   (TWO A SECOND)`; `NEXT TAB CLICKS <n>   CLOSE CLICKS <n>`; `OPENS <n>   FLAGS <f>`; `GAME PAUSED <n>`; `MENUS <n>[...]`; `DAYS PASSED <d.dddd>` |

How it runs, the channel's way:

- **Main thread** (SFSE's task, in `Toggle` before each kShow and in `SendUpdate` before each kUpdate, so about twice
  a second while open): `PageCollect` reads every value and formats both tabs under a lock. All reads of the game and
  the two calls into it (`LookupByID` at the first open, `GetActorValue`) happen here.
- **Menu's thread** (our `ProcessMessage`): kShow sets tab 1, adds our two `FunctionHandler`s as the buttons'
  `"click"` listeners (once per movie, `step=listen name=<button> ... added=1`) and writes the tab; every kUpdate writes
  it again and reads each field back (`step=page n=<k> ... fields=8/8 set=8 match=8 text="<all eight lines>"`, for
  n = 1 to 20, then every 20th, and on the first 20 that do not read back).
- **The buttons:** the handlers only count and raise a flag (`step=click button=tab n=<k> tab=<t>`, `step=click
  button=close n=<k>`). The key thread then sends an update at once (NEXT TAB), or closes the menu on the main thread
  as F10 does (CLOSE: `step=close n=<k> by=button was_open=1 sent=hide`, then `step=state n=<k> open=0 expected=0
  match=yes`; a close counts as a press in the `n` of these lines).
- **Flags:** `PageFlagSets` (default `0x19` since FAL-414: `0x9`, the set at which test C's clicks reached our menu, plus bit 4 (`0x10`), which puts StopContextProcessing (78) on the control map's stack so Tab arrives as Cancel; PC sweep at 14176a5e: bit 1 `0x2` pauses the game, bit 8 `0x100` blanks the world, bits 6, 9, 10, 18, 25, 27 showed nothing; the game does not pause at `0x19`) cycles per open like
  `FlagSets`. **Pause** (FAL-446, the owner's call: a setting with both modes): `Pause=0` (shipped) leaves the sets as
  they are, the game runs behind the Pip-Boy; `Pause=1` adds bit 1 (`0x2`) to every set, which paused the game in that
  sweep; `step=load_d` / `load_e` logs `pause=<0 or 1>` with the resulting `flag_sets=`. Whether `Pause=1` becomes the
  shipped default (the owner's "paused", 11 Nov) is decided by its own run: `docs/spikes/pipboy-pause-trial-card.md` (FAL-565). DATA's `GAME PAUSED` is the pause byte, live: at `e7925e00` no set paused the game.

Where each value comes from, and what is checked before it is used:

| Value | Read | Checked first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| health (`Health` `0x2D4`), carry weight (`CarryWeight` `0x2DC`), experience (`Experience` `0x2C9`), `FO4SF_Rads` | the player's `ActorValueOwner::GetActorValue` with that `ActorValueInfo` form | the three of Starfield.esm (the PC's read of the file, 11 Nov): looked up by form id and accepted by their RTTI type `ActorValueInfo` (at `3eb30d71` an editor-ID check passed only Health). `FO4SF_Rads`: by editor ID at local id `0x800` of each full plugin `01`-`FD` and light plugin `FE000`-`FEFFF`. The call: next line |
| the `GetActorValue` slot | the player's `ActorValueOwner` vtable, slot 0x01 | the base's offset from `PlayerCharacter`'s RTTI class hierarchy; that subobject's vtable locator names `PlayerCharacter` at that offset; slot 0x00 is the adjustor thunk to the player's own slot 0x00 (its destructor). libxse declares a virtual destructor before `GetActorValue`, SFSE 0.2.21 none: the thunk decides. Otherwise `refuse step=page what=get_actor_value ...` and every actor value is `?` |
| level | the player's base object (`OBJ_REFR::objectReference`), its `TESActorBaseData`, `ACTOR_BASE_DATA::level` | the base is a `TESNPC` by RTTI; the base class offset from its hierarchy, its subobject checked as above. That the player's level lives there is a **supported hypothesis** (it does in Skyrim and Fallout 4) |
| cell, worldspace | `TESObjectREFR::parentCell`, then `TESObjectCELL::cellWorldspace`; each name through its `TESFullName` (the pool string at +0x08) | `TESObjectCELL` and `TESWorldSpace` by RTTI; `TESFullName`'s offset from the hierarchy, subobject checked. An exterior cell usually has no name: `NO NAME` and its form id, which changes as the player crosses cells |
| game time | the `GameHour` and `GameDaysPassed` globals, each a float at one offset found in the game | looked up by form id, `Starfield.esm`'s `00000038` and `00000039` (docs/ai/test-queue.md; the PC confirmed them), accepted by their RTTI type `TESGlobal` (at `3eb30d71` an editor-ID check refused both). libxse's value offset +0x40 read `DAYS PASSED -3.5924` at `a156037c`, and the 4-byte slot at +0x28 (`TESForm::formID`, `38000000` and `39000000`) read as an hour and a day of about zero and passed at `6de5559a` (`TIME 00:00 DAY 1`). The game's own GetValue reads a float at **+0x48** (bytes `C4 C1 7A 10 40 48 C3`, `vmovss xmm0, [r8+0x48]`; the object is 0x50 bytes, form type 0x0A at +0x2E; FAL-384), so: +0x48 when the hour is in [0, 24), the days above 0 and below a million, and the hour within three game minutes of the days' fraction; else the first other 4-byte slot of +0x30 to +0x4C that passes; never +0x28. Until one is, `TIME ?` and `DAYS PASSED ?`; the 40 bytes (+0x28 to +0x4F) of both are logged once (`step=page_globals from=0x28 game_hour hex=... floats=... game_days_passed ...`), then `step=page_globals value_at=<offset>` |
| editor IDs and names | the `BSStringPool` entry (libxse: an 0x18-byte header, then the characters; flag 0x02 at +0x14 points on at +0x08) | `step=page_strings self_test=ok`: our own menu name read back through the same reader first; if it does not read back, no name and no form list is read |
| the form lookup | the engine's `TESForm::LookupByID` (libxse id 47401), the second call into the game | its address must equal SFSE 0.2.21's `GetFormByNumericID` `0x5DE3B0` (`sfse/GameForms.cpp`), else `refuse step=page_ids` and the plugin stays idle; libxse and SFSE both declare it `TESForm* (u32)`. Called on the main thread only, about 8,400 times once at the first open, never again |
| the data handler's lists (diagnostic only) | `TESDataHandler::formArrays` at +0x70, 0x18 each (libxse and SFSE 0.2.21 agree), which read empty at `5a4e6016` (`refuse step=page_forms list=AVIF reason=array size=0`, PC run 11 Nov) | `TESDataHandler.Singleton` 937572 must equal SFSE's `0x5FD9B28`; the object is a `TESDataHandler` by RTTI. Only its memory is logged, once: `step=page_form_arrays avif=<3 qwords> glob=<3 qwords> nonzero_count=<n> <index>:<3 qwords>...`, so a later page can use the lists |

The page's checks never stop the plugin: a value that fails prints `?` and its reason is logged once, as
`step=page_unknown what=<value> reason=...`. `step=page_forms lookup=by_form_id known=<name>:<id>:form=<0|1>:type=<rtti>:
bytes2c=<4 bytes at +0x2C>:name=<editor id as read>:<used|refused> ... avif_ids=<id>=<editor id>,...` says, for each fixed
form, what the lookup gave, and lists every `ActorValueInfo` among `0x001`-`0xFFF` with its editor ID as read. The
carried weight is not on the page: Starfield.esm has no `InventoryWeight` actor value (the PC's read). Nor are credits:
no plain getter exists for an item count.

**Verified at `5a4e6016` and `3eb30d71` (PC runs, 11 Nov):** the page, both buttons, F10, the string self test, the
slot thunk (`owner_offset=0x70`, slot 0x01), the level (`LEVEL 1` = `player.getlevel`), the cell line, `menus=`, the
form lookup and `HEALTH 205` (= `player.getav health`). **Verified at `a156037c`:** `XP 60` and `CARRY WEIGHT MAX 135`
through their fixed form ids. **Not verified until the next session:** the time (`TIME ?` and `DAYS PASSED -3.5924` at
+0x40 there; the offset is now found and checked as above).

## Stage (e): the page kit (FAL-301)

The owner's order of 11 Nov: several pages and a baseline for making them, with the Fallout 4 look, then the raise
animation. This stage is the baseline. A page is a few lines of data; adding one needs no C++ and no new movie by hand.

**The movie** (`scripts/ui/make_pipboy_kit.py`, staged with `make_pipboy_probe.py stage <exp> --kit` under the same name
`Interface/FO4SF_PipboyMenu.swf`) has no code. It draws one dark screen in one phosphor colour (`--color RRGGBB`,
default `1AFF80`); the screen, the dim text, the footer boxes, the frames and the scan lines are derived from that one
colour. The Fallout 4 look, first cut (FAL-431, shapes only): the screen's frame with cut corners, scan lines (2 px every
6 px, also inside each hit area so a click on one still names the area), the filled selection bar and a frame round the
value rows. Its font is stage (d)'s 5 x 7 table plus `[ ] < > * ;`. The plugin finds each part by name and changes only `text` and `visible`:

| Part | Names | What the plugin does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title bar | `fo4sfTitle`, `fo4sfHeaderInfo` | the kit's title; on the right, the `[Kit]` `Header=` value (the game time) |
| main tabs | `fo4sfTab<i>`, `fo4sfTabMark<i>`, `fo4sfTabHit<i>` | the label; the bracket around the shown tab (`visible`); the click area |
| sub-tabs | `fo4sfSub<i>`, `fo4sfSubDim<i>`, `fo4sfSubHit<i>` (5 slots) | the shown tab's sub-tabs, the current one bright and the others dim |
| list | `fo4sfRowName<i>`, `fo4sfRowValue<i>`, `fo4sfRowNameSel<i>`, `fo4sfRowValueSel<i>`, `fo4sfBar<i>`, `fo4sfRowHit<i>` (16 rows) | each row's label and right-aligned value; on the selected row the bar and the dark copy of the text are shown and the bright copy is hidden |
| scrolling | `fo4sfMoreUp`, `fo4sfMoreDown` | shown while rows lie above or below the 16 on screen |
| value rows | `fo4sfInfoLabel<i>`, `fo4sfInfoValue<i>` (16 rows) | the selected row's details in two columns |
| footer | `fo4sfFoot<i>` (3 cells), `fo4sfHints`, `fo4sfClose` | the page's footer cells, the key hints, the CLOSE button |
| check | `fo4sfKitId` | the kit's signature, drawn in the screen's colour so it stays invisible; read at each new movie |

The hit areas are sprites filled in the screen's own colour, under the text, so they cannot be seen. A click on a
tab, a sub-tab or a row is reported under one of that row's names, whether it lands on the text or beside it.

**The pages** are sections of `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini`. The plugin reads them at load (`ReadKit`) and
`make_pipboy_kit.py` reads them to draw the main tabs (`--check` prints them). Both apply the same grammar and checks:

- `[Kit]`: `Title=`, `Header=<value>`, `Hints=`, `Mission=`, `MissionStageAt=` and `MissionObjective=` (below, the
  `quests` list), `HeadingAt=` and `GridUnits=` (below, `heading` and `grid`).
- `[Page <TAB>/<SUB>]`: a page. Main tabs come in the order of their first page (up to 5); sub-tabs come in page
  order (up to 5 per tab). A page has exactly one of:
  - `Row=<label>|<value>` lines (up to 64, 16 on screen, scrolled);
  - `List=<list>`;
  - `Notice=<text>` lines (up to 16).
  It may also have up to three `Footer=<label>|<value>` cells and a `Hint=`.
- Labels are upper case, in the kit's font, and fit their field: 33 characters for a row or a notice, 9 for a tab, 13
  for a sub-tab, 10 for a footer cell.

A wrong line stops the kit at load: `refuse step=pages line=<n> reason=<r>`, and the plugin stays idle. A page whose
row value is longer than 8 characters shows that value after its label, in the label's column.

| Page | Content |
| --- | --- |
| STAT / STATUS | rows: health, level, experience, carry weight max, rads, cell, world, time; footer HP, LEVEL, XP |
| STAT / SPECIAL | rows: Strength to Luck, `av:2C2` to `av:2C8` (Starfield.esm keeps Fallout 4's ids); the same footer |
| INV / ITEMS | `List=inventory`: the player's items, name and count, sorted by name (FAL-426) |
| DATA / QUESTS | `List=quests`: our mission first, the quest `[Kit] Mission=` names (FAL-431) |
| DATA / KIT TEST | `List=kit_test`: thirty rows to scroll, select and click |
| MAP / WORLD | rows: world, cell, position, heading, grid, time, days passed (FAL-426: the map's first content; FAL-595: heading and grid, `?` until the PC's reads set them; the drawn map waits for the map track, `docs/spikes/pipboy-map-page-plan.md`) |
| RADIO / STATIONS | notice: waits for its own track (the radio) |

**Value providers.** Every value is read on the main thread, with stage (d)'s reads and two calls only. When one
cannot be read it prints `?`, and its reason is logged once as `step=page_unknown what=<value> reason=<r>`.

| Value | Reads | When it cannot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `health`, `xp`, `carry_max` | the player's `GetActorValue` with Starfield.esm's `Health` `0x2D4`, `Experience` `0x2C9`, `CarryWeight` `0x2DC` (stage (d)) | `what=health`, `experience`, `carry_weight`: `reason=no_such_actor_value`, `no_get_actor_value` or `not_finite` |
| `rads` | `FO4SF_Rads` the same way; `NOT INSTALLED` without the rads probe | `what=rads reason=actor_values_unread` |
| `level` | the base `TESNPC`'s `ACTOR_BASE_DATA::level` (stage (d)) | `what=level reason=base ...` or `actor_base_data ...` |
| `cell`, `world` | the parent cell and its worldspace, each name with its form id (stage (d)); FAL-595: the worldspace is read at `+0x110`, `NONE (INTERIOR)` when it is 0. **Verified at `4d1e7641`** (PC, 12 Nov): libxse's `cellWorldspace` at `+0x118` read 0 everywhere, and the scan below found `at=+110 name="Mars (FF0054DF)"` on all three outdoor presses in two cells and `found=0` indoors. F11 logs each word of the cell from `+0x38` to `+0x200` that is a `TESWorldSpace` by RTTI (`step=kit_map_world n= at=+<offset> world= name=`, then `step=kit_map_worlds n= cell= found=`) and `scripts/ui/pipboy_map_bytes.py <log> --world` names the offset found outdoors and not indoors | `what=cell reason=cell ...`, `what=cell_name`, `what=world reason=...` |
| `time` | `GameHour` `0x38` and `GameDaysPassed` `0x39` at the value offset found and checked as at (d): `hh:mm   DAY n` | `what=time reason=globals_unread`, `no_value_offset` or `out_of_range` |
| `days` | `GameDaysPassed`, two decimals, checked as the time is | `what=days reason=globals_unread`, `no_value_offset` or `out_of_range` |
| `position` | the player's position, whole units | `what=position reason=no_player` |
| `heading` | FAL-595: the player's heading in compass degrees (`0` to `359`), the float at `[Kit] HeadingAt=[-]<80\|84\|88>` among the player's `OBJ_REFR::angle` (libxse, `+0x80`, radians), read with `Peek` only, negated when the line has `-` (the float falls as the player turns right); logged once, `step=kit_heading heading_at=<offset> rad=<r> deg=<d>`. **Verified at `e2e551c8`** (PC, 12 Nov): `player.setangle z 0` then `z 90` moved `+088` from `0.0000` to `1.5708`, so `HeadingAt=88` ships. F11 at stage (e) logs the player's 64 bytes from `+0x80` and the six floats there, `step=kit_map_bytes n=<snapshot> at=+080 bytes=<hex> floats=<six>`: F11, turn on the spot about 90° right, F11 again, and `scripts/ui/pipboy_map_bytes.py <log>` marks the float that turned and prints the `HeadingAt=` line | `what=heading reason=no_heading_at` without the setting, `reason=unreadable` |
| `grid` | FAL-595: the player's cell on the grid, `x y`, POSITION's x and y over `[Kit] GridUnits=<decimal>` (1 to 65536), rounded down; `NONE (INTERIOR)` where WORLD says so (the PC's indoor press had libxse's `kInterior` clear in `cellFlags`, so the flags are not used); logged at the first read and at each change, `step=kit_grid units=<u> x=<x> y=<y>`. **Verified at `4d1e7641`** (PC, 12 Nov): `cell_x` and `cell_y` were x and y over 100 on every outdoor press, and `modpos y 60` took y from -1553.29 to -1493.29 and `cell_y` from -16 to -15, so `GridUnits=100` ships. The same F11 logs the player's cell and its own grid, `step=kit_map_cell n=<snapshot> cell=<addr> world=<addr> flags=<hex> data=<addr> cell_x=<x> cell_y=<y>` (libxse 9d090c4: `cellData` `+0x58`, an `EXTERIOR_DATA` with `cellX`, `cellY` at `+0`, `+4`). On the PC (12 Nov) `cell_x` was x over 100 on five presses: Starfield's units, not Fallout 4's 4096. F11 in one cell, walk 30 to 60 past a multiple of 100, F11 again, and `pipboy_map_bytes.py <log> --grid` prints `GridUnits=100` when x and y both match (indoor presses, whose worldspace scan found none, are left out) | `what=grid reason=no_grid_units` without the setting, `reason=world`, `reason=no_player` |
| `av:<hex>` | the player's `GetActorValue` with the `ActorValueInfo` form of that form id. The form is looked up once by its id and accepted by its RTTI type, with stage (d)'s `AcceptById`, logged as `step=kit_av av:<id>:form=<0 or 1>:type=<rtti>:...:<used or refused>` | `what=av:<hex> reason=no_such_actor_value` |

Lists: `kit_test` (thirty rows, no read of the game), `inventory` (FAL-426) and `quests` (FAL-431). `[Kit]
Mission=<plugin file>|<local id hex>` names our mission (`FO4SFMission.esm|800`, `FO4SF_Min00` "When Freedom Calls",
the PC's read of the installed plugin); a wrong one refuses the kit as any wrong line does. `[Kit]
MissionStageAt=<hex offset>` (FAL-527, not shipped) names where that mission keeps its current stage: a u16, an even
offset from `38` to `336` (inside the F11 dump), 1 to 3 hex digits as `scripts/ui/pipboy_quest_bytes.py` prints it.
`[Kit] MissionObjective=<n>|<path>` (FAL-571, not shipped, up to 8 lines, each `<n>` once; without any the page walks
the mission's objectives itself, below) names where objective `<n>`
(decimal, as the console takes it: the mission has 10, 85 and 86) keeps its state: `<path>` is 2 or 3 offsets of 1 to
3 hex digits joined by `/`, read from the quest: a pointer at each offset but the last (the first a multiple of 8 from
`38` to `330`, a middle one a multiple of 8 from `0` to `38`), then the state's byte at the last (`0` to `3F`), as
`scripts/ui/pipboy_quest_bytes.py --objective <n>` prints it.

| List | Reads (libxse 9d090c4's layouts, each to be confirmed by the PC's log) | When it cannot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inventory` | the player's `TESObjectREFR::inventoryList` at `+0xA0`, accepted by its RTTI type `BGSInventoryList`; its `data` array at `+0x28` (at most 512 items); each `BGSInventoryItem` (`0x28` bytes): the object at `+0x00` (an RTTI `TESBoundObject`, its `TESFullName`, else its form id), the stacks at `+0x10` (each `0x10` bytes, the count the u32 at `+0x08`: the PC's `step=kit_inventory` read `01000000` there, 11 Nov; libxse's comment says `+0x10`, which its own size contradicts), the equip flags at `+0x20`. Rows sorted by name; the value rows: FORM, TYPE, STACKS, EQUIPPED. The first read logs `step=kit_inventory list=<addr> type=<rtti> size=<n> capacity=<n> first_item=<40 bytes> first_stack=<16 bytes>` once, which settles the count's offset | one row `INVENTORY NOT READ` and `what=inventory reason=no_player`, `list_type list=<addr> type=<rtti>` or `items size=<n> capacity=<n> data=<addr>`; an item whose object is not a bound object shows `?` |
| `quests` | our mission: its `TESFile` by name in the data handler's `compiledFileCollection` at `+0x1580` (`files`, `smallFiles`, `mediumFiles`, each accepted by its RTTI type as `TESFile` or a type with `TESFile` as its base at `+0`: the game's lists hold `TESPackedFile`, FAL-437; the name at `+0x38`; files skipped for their type are counted and logged once, `step=kit_file file=<file> skipped=<n> type=<rtti>`), the form id that file gives the local id (full: `compileIndex` `+0x1B7`, then `fileIndex` `+0x218`; small `FE` + 12 bits; medium `FD` + 16 bits) through the engine's lookup, accepted only as an RTTI `TESQuest`; its name (`TESFullName`, `+0x40` in Starfield's RTTI) and its flags (u16 at `+0x10C`, shown raw as FLAGS; the PC's game run at `3d5354e5` read `0162` with the mission started and not finished, one state, so the bits are not named yet). The value rows: FORM, FILE, FLAGS, STAGE (the u16 at `MissionStageAt=`, read with `Peek` only, in decimal, logged at the first read and at each change as `step=kit_quest_stage form=<id> stage_at=+<offset> stage=<n>`; `?` without the setting, `what=quest_stage reason=no_stage_at`, or when it cannot be read, `reason=unreadable`). The first read logs `step=kit_quest mission=<file>|<id> found=yes form=<id> quest=<addr> type=<rtti> name="<name>" flags=<hex> bytes100=<64 bytes> file_kind=<n> ... tried=<id>:<type>` once (or `found=no` and what was tried, `reason=file_not_loaded skipped=<n>` when no file matched). The snapshot key (F11) also logs the mission's bytes from `+0x38` to `+0x338` (libxse's `TESQuest` to its `startEventData`), 64 to a line, `step=kit_quest_bytes n=<snapshot> form=<id> at=+<offset> bytes=<64 bytes>` (`reason=quests_page_not_read` before the page has shown it): F11, the console's `setstage <form id> <n>` to another stage, F11 again, and `scripts/ui/pipboy_quest_bytes.py <log> --stages <before>,<after>` lists the words that changed and marks the stage's (FAL-446); when it marks exactly one, it prints the `MissionStageAt=` line for `[Kit]` (FAL-527). The console takes the mission by its form id as FORM shows it (`setstage 07000800 20` on the PC's load order: the first two digits are the plugin's load index, so read the id off FORM on another load order); by its editor ID it refuses it ("not found for parameter Quest", PC run, 12 Nov). **Verified at `10409137`** (PC, 12 Nov): two dumps around `setstage 07000800 20` and `30` differ in one marked word, `+0x328 10 -> 30`; with `MissionStageAt=328` the log read `step=kit_quest_stage ... stage=10`, `30`, then `200` (after `setstage 07000800 40` the mission's script ran on), and STAGE on the page read the same. **Objectives (FAL-571):** the value rows add one row per objective of the mission, `OBJECTIVE <n>` with its state named: `NOT SHOWN` (0), `SHOWN` (1), `DONE` (3, shown and completed); any other value raw as `STATE <n>` (a failed objective's value is not read yet). Read with `Peek` only, from the quest's objectives, a libxse `BSTArray` (size and capacity, u32 each, at `+0x148`; the data, one pointer per objective in order, at `+0x150`); in each objective the quest's own address at `+0x18`, its number (u16) at `+0x24`, its state (a byte) at `+0x28`. The array is read only when its size is at most its capacity and at most 64, and every entry is read in full and points back to this quest at `+0x18`; else one row `OBJECTIVES ?` (`what=quest_objectives reason=head ...` or `reason=objective index=<i> objective=<addr> owner=<addr>`), never a half-read list. An empty array shows `OBJECTIVES NONE`. At most 12 rows: past 11 the 12th is `MORE OBJECTIVES <count>`. Logged when it changes: `step=kit_quest_objectives form=<id> at=+148 size=<n> capacity=<n> objectives=<n>,...` (or the reason), and each state at the first read and at each change, `step=kit_quest_objective form=<id> objective=<n> from=array state=<n>`. `[Kit] MissionObjective=` lines, when there are any, override the walk: then only those objectives are shown, each read along its path (`from=path=+<offset>/...`; `?` and `what=objective:<n> reason=unreadable` when a read faults). **Verified at `73271aa3`** (PC, 12 Nov, the mission at `07000800`): every F11 logged `kit_quest_objs followed=35 owned=5`; one byte changed per console command (`setobjectivedisplayed 07000800 85 1`: `+150/+08 +0x28 0 -> 1`; `setobjectivecompleted 07000800 85 1`: `1 -> 3`; `setobjectivecompleted 07000800 10 1`: `+150/+00 +0x28 1 -> 3`; `setobjectivedisplayed 07000800 86 1`: `+150/+10 +0x28 0 -> 1`); the helper printed `MissionObjective=10|150/0/28`, `85|150/8/28`, `86|150/10/28`, and with them the rows read `1/0/0`, then 85 `1`, then 10 `3`. The owned blocks showed the quest's address at `+0x18`, the numbers `0a`, `55`, `56` at `+0x24`; the block at `+150/+20` was not an objective (zeros, the quest's address at `+0x38`), which is why the walk is bounded by the array's own size and checks `+0x18` on every entry. The array's size at `+0x148` is libxse's `BSTArray` layout (as the inventory reads it), not yet seen in this quest's log: the PC's `kit_quest_bytes ... at=+138` line holds it at bytes `0x10` to `0x17` (`03000000` and a capacity of at least 3 expected), and the walk's own `step=kit_quest_objectives ... size=3` line shows it. The F11 dump of the blocks behind the quest's pointers (`step=kit_quest_obj n=<snapshot> form=<id> path=+<offset>[/+<offset>] at=<address> bytes=<64 bytes>`, then `step=kit_quest_objs n=<snapshot> form=<id> followed=<blocks read> owned=<blocks logged>`; `VirtualQuery` then `Peek`, two hops, only blocks that hold the quest's own address) and `scripts/ui/pipboy_quest_bytes.py <log> --objective <n>` (F11, `setobjectivedisplayed <form id> <n> 1` or `setobjectivecompleted <form id> <n> 1`, F11 again; it marks the changed byte in a block that holds `<n>` and prints the `MissionObjective=` line) stay, to find another quest's layout; `owned=0` on every press would say a wider dump is needed (a third hop, or every block followed). Starfield's own quests are not listed yet | one row `QUESTS NOT READ` and `what=quests reason=no_mission` or `mission_not_found mission=<file>\|<id>` |

**How it runs.** The pattern is stage (d)'s:

- On the main thread, `KitCollect` builds the shown page's screen (in `Toggle` before each kShow, and in `SendUpdate`
  before each kUpdate).
- On the menu's thread, `KitWrite` sets only what changed since the last read-back, and reads each change back.
  `step=kit n=<k> update=<u> show=<0 or 1> page=<TAB>/<SUB> root=1 collected=1 changed=<c> set=<s> match=<m> missing=0
  bar=<row> footer="..." rows="..."` is logged for n = 1 to 20, then every 20th, and on the first 20 problems.
- At each new movie, `step=kit_movie id="<read>" expected="<ours>" match=yes` checks that the movie was staged from the
  same pages. Then come `step=listen name=root ... added=1` and `step=listen name=fo4sfClose ... button=1 ... added=1`.
- The state is kept while the page is closed, so the page opens where it was left. It is the main tab, each tab's
  sub-tab, and each page's selection and first row on screen.

**Keys** (`KitUp` to `KitNextTab` in the ini, up to three each, never `Key` or `SnapshotKey`). They are read by the key
thread every 30 ms, only while the page is open and the game is in front. Each press is logged as `step=kit_key vk=<vk>
action=<a> index=0 moved=<0 or 1> page=<TAB>/<SUB> selected=<n>`, and an update follows at once. Up and Down repeat
when held (after 420 ms, every 90 ms). No move wraps around.

| Action | Default keys |
| --- | --- |
| selection up, down | Up arrow or W (`0x26,0x57`), Down arrow or S (`0x28,0x53`) |
| sub-tab left, right | Left arrow or A (`0x25,0x41`), Right arrow or D (`0x27,0x44`) |
| main tab left, right | Q (`0x51`), E (`0x45`) |
| close | F10 (`Key`), as at every stage; the CLOSE button |

*Which keys the game lets through at `0x9`:* the plugin reads the keyboard itself (`GetAsyncKeyState`), so it sees
every key whatever the game does with it. The PC runs at `0x9` (FAL-216, FAL-272) showed that W does not move the
player, that the game draws its own pointer, and that F10 and F11 reach the key thread. What the game *also* does with
A, S, D, Q, E, the arrows, Tab and Esc while the page is open has not been seen. The owner's card records it (step 7
and the report). Tab is not bound by default for that reason; `KitNextTab=0x45,0x09` adds it.

**Clicks:**

- One listener on the movie's root hears every click. It reads the event's `target`, then that object's `name`
  (`step=kit_click n=<k> args=1 target=1 name=<name> action=<a> ...`).
- A name ending in a number moves the kit: `fo4sfTab*`, `fo4sfTabMark*` and `fo4sfTabHit*` pick a main tab; the
  `fo4sfSub*` names pick a sub-tab; the row names select that row.
- CLOSE keeps stage (d)'s own listener and handler, the proven path.

**Not verified until the session:**

- that `visible` sets and reads back on our sprites and fields;
- that a click event's `target` carries the instance name, for a text field and for a hit sprite;
- that the root's listener hears clicks that land on its children;
- what the keys do in the game at `0x9`;
- how the layout looks at the PC's resolution (ShowAll keeps the 16:9 stage).

**The look (part 3):** the frame, the scan lines, the filled bar and the value rows' frame are in (FAL-431, first cut);
a slight glow and a better font come next. The colour is already one setting. The planned route for the font and the Vault Boy pictures:

- **Font:** ours, generated like this one. Nothing from either game goes into Git, the kit runs with or without
  Fallout 4 installed, and the tests stay byte-exact.
- **Vault Boy pictures:** they are Fallout 4's art and cannot be drawn by us. They come only by converting the
  player's own Fallout 4 interface files on their PC, as the port does for everything else, after the PC survey names
  those files.

`-Out`. Nothing is installed. Exit 1 after `build.cmd exit 90` (configure) or `91` (build): see `xmake_output.txt`.

Stage the plugin and movie, and check the plugin (stage (c): `stage <exp folder> --channel`; stage (d): `stage <exp
folder> --page`; stage (e): `stage <exp folder> --kit`, from the same ini that is installed beside the dll; the movie
keeps its name):

```
python scripts/ui/make_pipboy_probe.py stage <exp folder>
python scripts/ui/make_pipboy_probe.py check <exp folder>\FO4SFPipboyProbe.esm
```

## Install and uninstall (probe session only, game closed)

Install:

1. Copy `FO4SFPipboyMenu.dll`, `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini` and `versionlib-1-16-244-0.bin` into
   `<Starfield>\Data\SFSE\Plugins\`. Set `Stage=1`, `2`, `3`, `4` or `5` in that copy of the ini (at (e) its pages
   must be those the movie was staged from: `step=kit_movie ... match=yes`).
2. Stages (b) to (e): `python scripts/ui/pipboy_probe_install.py install --dir <exp folder> --starfield <game>`.
   This checks the stage, activates `FO4SFPipboyProbe.esm` and packs its `Data` tree into
   `FO4SFPipboyProbe - Main.ba2`, under its own record `Data\FO4SFPipboyProbe.install.json`; the installed
   experiment's `FO4SFExp.install.json` is not read or changed. A `plugin_toggle.py` hold makes it refuse, so run it
   between `plugin_toggle.py on` and `off`. `status`, `order` and `active` take `--starfield <game>` alone.
   With `Movie=<name>` (stage (b)), add `--extra-movie <name>` to install: the stage's `Data\Interface\<name>.swf`,
   the player's private movie, is packed too (`<name>` is `FO4SF_` and letters, digits, `_`; the file must be a
   whole SWF: signature, FileLength and every tag's length, no tag's contents read). Anything else in `Data` that is not a byte-for-byte twin is still refused.
   With the extra movie only, `--page-movie <page>` (once per page) packs `Data\Interface\<page>.swf` too, the
   player's own tab movie under Fallout 4's name, for the shell to load (FAL-614 S1). `<page>` is one of
   `Pipboy_StatsPage`, `Pipboy_InvPage`, `Pipboy_DataPage`, `Pipboy_MapPage`, `Pipboy_RadioPage`; each is checked as a
   whole SWF like the extra movie.

Uninstall:

1. Stages (b) to (e): `python scripts/ui/pipboy_probe_install.py uninstall --starfield <game>`. This removes
   exactly what its record lists and the Plugins.txt line it added.
2. Delete `FO4SFPipboyMenu.dll` and `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini` from `Data\SFSE\Plugins\`. Delete
   `versionlib-1-16-244-0.bin` too, unless it was there before the session.
3. Compare with the receipts taken before the install.

**Log:** `Documents\My Games\Starfield\SFSE\Logs\FO4SFPipboyMenu.log`. `SFSE::Init` opens it, named after the plugin.

## World surface (FAL-250)

One question: **can the movie (b) shows as a centred overlay be drawn on a surface in the world**, a mesh you can
walk around? Spec: FAL-248 document `wrist-pipboy`, section 4. Not this probe: the worn Pip-Boy, the arm raise, the
camera, input, power armor, the data channel.

`World=1` next to `Stage=2` adds two things, in `src/world.cpp`. With `World=0` (as shipped) none of it runs and the
log is #704's. It runs only after every check above passed (runtime 1.16.244.0, the Address Library file, the IMenu
ids, vtables and RTTI), and it adds no id and no hook. Its first line, after `step=ready`, is `step=world_config
world_key= world_menu= world_movie=`, or one `refuse step=world` line and the overlay probe runs alone.

- **Census.** When our menu registers, every menu name the UI has registered (`step=census_registered`), then one
  `step=census_registered_done ... leads=` line: the names holding `test`, `dynamic`, `textur`, `geo`, `terminal`,
  `kiosk`, `cockpit`, `screen`, `monitor`, `display`, `watch`, `slate` or `3d`. Then every menu whose movie SFSE's
  own `IMenu::LoadMovie` hook reports, once per name and flag set: `step=census_movie menu= result= class= flags=
  movie= depth= lead=`. `result=1` means the menu holds a movie after the engine's loader returned (SFSE's hook does
  not pass the return value on). `class` is the decorated name the menu's RTTI gives (`outside_image` for ours: its
  vtable is our copy). This is the flag dump the candidate is chosen from; libxse leaves the flag bits unnamed.
- **World candidate.** `WorldKey` (F8) sends show, then hide, to `WorldMenu`, one vanilla menu named from the census,
  with `step=world_toggle` and, 750 ms later, `step=world_state` (open, expected, and the menu's class, flags and
  movie). Each time that menu loads a movie: `step=world_load_movie menu= result= movie_file=`. Its movie comes from
  the probe archive only: `python scripts/ui/make_pipboy_probe.py twin <exp folder> Interface/<file>` writes our movie
  again, byte for byte (label included), at that vanilla path; `WorldMovie` names it in the log.
  `pipboy_probe_install.py` packs a twin with the movie and refuses one that is not byte for byte the movie.
  `Starfield - Interface.ba2` is never changed.

What it reads: the UI's menu map (libxse `UI::menuMap`, the table #704's `IsMenuRegistered` already reads), each
menu's name, flags and movie (libxse's IMenu layout, which #704 uses), and the RTTI locator before a vtable, each
address inside Starfield.exe's image first. What it calls: what the overlay key calls (`UI::IsMenuOpen`,
`UIMessageQueue::AddMessage`), and one `BSFixedString` for the candidate's name.

### Candidates, in order: stop at the first the census makes declarable

| # | Candidate | In this build | Declarable when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ~~vanilla `testmenus_dynamictexturedgeo`~~ dropped | | the PC read the file (10 Nov): a 4.9 kB renderer test of shapes with one name, `Scene`, not a movie on an object |
| 2 | a vanilla terminal, kiosk or cockpit screen (first `TerminalMenu`, `GenesisTerminalMenu`, then `DataSlateMenu` with `WorldMenu=`) | use the object in the game, or the key; a twin at the screen's movie path | `step=census_movie` lists the menu that opens with that screen |
| 3 | one throwaway NIF/material in the probe plugin | not built | (1) and (2) give no hook; it needs a dump of a vanilla material first |

Two **hypotheses** the pictures settle: a vanilla menu loads `Interface/<its name>.swf` or `.gfx`, as ours loads
`Interface/FO4SF_PipboyMenu.swf` (names in the notes fit: `hudmenu.gfx`, `monoclemenu.swf`; the PC's interface list
names the real file); and the probe archive wins over `Starfield - Interface.ba2` for the same path. A twin under a
`.gfx` name keeps the SWF header. A menu whose own `LoadMovie` never reaches `IMenu::LoadMovie` is not in the census.

### Job card (FAL-250)

The build, install and uninstall of (b). Two passes; the game is closed between them. No step needs a save of its
own; load one that starts next to a terminal (a ship's cockpit nearby helps).

**Pass 1, the census and the overlay control** (no twin):

1. Plugin ini: `Stage=2`, `World=1`, `WorldMenu=` and `WorldMovie=` empty. Stage and install as (b).
2. Load the save; wait until in control.
3. Overlay control: F10, screenshot, F10.
4. F8 once: `refuse step=world_toggle n=1 reason=no_world_menu` (census only).
5. Use the terminal: activate it, wait for its screen, leave it. If there is a ship: sit in the pilot seat, stand up.
6. Quit. Report, names only: `leads=`, every `step=census_movie` line with `lead=1`, the terminal's and the
   cockpit's `step=census_movie` lines, and the PC's `Starfield - Interface.ba2` list filtered for those names (file
   names, nothing of their content).
7. Pick the candidate by the table above.

**Pass 2, the world candidate** (same build):

1. Uninstall pass 1's archive. `make_pipboy_probe.py stage <exp folder>`, then `make_pipboy_probe.py twin <exp
   folder> Interface/<the candidate's file>`; install.
2. Plugin ini: `WorldMovie=Interface/<that file>`; candidate 1 also `WorldMenu=<its name>`.
3. Load the same save. Overlay control again: F10, screenshot, F10.
4. Candidate 1: F8 (show). Candidate 2: use the terminal or sit in the seat.
5. Screenshot the surface, then a second one after moving the camera: walk round it, or put something in front of
   it.
6. Negative: F8 again (hide), or leave the terminal or the seat. Screenshot the same surface.
7. Quit; uninstall; compare with the receipts.

### PASS (FAL-250): all three, no crash

1. **Overlay control.** The (b) PASS: `step=load_movie ... stage=b result=1`, the green card centred, the label.
2. **World candidate.** The overlay is closed (the last `step=state ... open=0`); the candidate loaded a movie
   (`step=world_load_movie menu=<name> result=1 movie_file=<twin>`, or for a screen its `step=census_movie ...
   result=1`); the screenshot shows `FO4SF PIP-BOY PROBE` on a surface in the world: foreshortened with it, hidden by
   what is in front of it, moving or leaving the frame as the camera moves.
3. **Negative.** After the hide, the surface no longer shows our card (it was the movie, not a baked texture).

### Inconclusive (do not call these PASS)

- The card is still a screen overlay: no perspective, nothing in the world hides it.
- A picture like ours without the label, or no `result=1` line for the candidate: not our movie.
- Vanilla art on the surface: the twin did not reach the menu (path, `.gfx` header or archive order); re-check the
  path in the interface list.
- No second view (camera moved, or something in front).
- A hang or a crash before both views: the last line names the step.
- Any method that changes `Starfield - Interface.ba2`: it would not prove our movie.

**A useful FAIL:** the overlay control passes and the world path is refused with a named step, for example
`refuse step=world_toggle ... reason=not_registered` for every candidate name, or the census shows that the
terminal's menu is a screen overlay. Then the wrist goes to the flat fallback (#704's overlay), unless candidate 3
finds a material that names a render target.

### What each world line means

| Line | Meaning | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `refuse step=world reason=needs_movie_stage` | `World=1` without the movie stage | `Stage=2` |
| `refuse step=world reason=key` | `WorldKey` is 0, above 0xFE, or the menu's key | fix the ini |
| `refuse step=world reason=world_menu` | `WorldMenu` has a character other than letters, digits and `_` | copy the name from the census |
| `refuse step=world reason=world_menu_is_ours` | `WorldMenu` names the overlay control | a vanilla name |
| `refuse step=world reason=world_movie` | `WorldMovie` has a character other than letters, digits and `_ . / \ -` | copy the twin's path |
| `refuse step=world_key_thread` | the key thread could not start | report |
| `refuse step=world_toggle n=<n> reason=no_world_menu` | census only, `WorldMenu` empty | expected in pass 1 |
| `refuse step=world_toggle n=<n> menu=<name> reason=not_registered` | the UI has no menu by that name; nothing was sent | a named FAIL for that candidate |
| `refuse step=world_toggle n=<n> menu=<name> reason=no_ui_or_queue` | pressed before the UI existed | press again once in play |
| `step=world_state ... match=no` | the candidate did not open or close as asked | read the census lines around it |
| `step=world_load_movie ... result=0` | the candidate loaded no movie | the twin's path or header is not what it loads |
| no `step=census_movie` line at all | SFSE gave no menu interface | report the SFSE version |
| `step=census_movie_full` | 256 menu and flag pairs listed | the first 256 are in the log |

## Job card

Load a save, wait until in control, then press the key ten times, about two seconds apart: five opens and five closes.
Take a screenshot while the menu is open after the fifth press, and one after the tenth.

### PASS at (a), `Stage=1`

1. The log shows, in this order: `step=load runtime=1.16.244.0 stage=1`, then `step=image`, sixteen `step=id` lines,
   three `step=rtti` lines, `step=slots`, `step=ctor`, `step=ready stage=a ... locator=<rva>`, `step=listen`,
   `step=post_data_load`, `step=register result=ok`, and `step=key_thread`.
2. Toggles: `step=toggle n=1..10`, alternating `sent=show` and `sent=hide`. Each toggle is followed by
   `step=state n=<same> ... match=yes`.
3. At least one `step=create ... vtables=engine rtti=engine`, and `step=message ... type=show` and `type=hide` lines.
4. No crash: the game is still running after the tenth press, and the second screenshot is the game in play.
5. Nothing of ours is visible at (a), because there is no movie. The open state is the log's `open=1`.

### PASS at (b), `Stage=2`

1. Everything in (a), with `stage=2` and `step=ready stage=b`.
2. `step=load_movie ... stage=b result=1 movie=<non-zero>`, and `step=sfse_movie_created` for our menu.
3. The open screenshot shows the green rectangle, centred, about 60 % by 50 % of the screen. It carries the dark label
   `FO4SF PIP-BOY PROBE`. The closed screenshot shows the game without it.

### (b) with `Movie=`: another movie in our menu (FAL-614)

`Movie=<name>` (1 to 64 letters, digits and `_`; empty = ours) makes the menu load `Interface/<name>.swf` instead of
ours. It works with `Stage=2` only, so no channel, page or kit tries to drive a movie that is not ours. Any other stage
with `Movie=` set, or a bad name, gives `refuse step=ini movie=...` and the plugin stays idle. At load:
`step=movie name=<name> file=Interface/<name>.swf`.

How it works (**hypothesis**, the PC's run decides): the engine's `LoadMovie` names the file after the menu's
`GetName`, as it loads `Interface/FO4SF_PipboyMenu.swf` for ours. While our `LoadMovie` runs the engine's, `GetName`
answers with `Movie=`; at every other time it answers `FO4SF_PipboyMenu`. The load logs
`step=load_movie ... result=<0 or 1> movie=<address> movie_name=<name> name_asks=<n>`. `name_asks=0` means the
engine did not ask for the name in that call, so the hypothesis is wrong whatever loaded.

It exists for proof 1 of `docs/spikes/pipboy-fo4-rebuild-plan.md`: the player's own Fallout 4 boot sequence, staged
on their PC only, never in Git.

`CodeObj=1` (with `Movie=` only; without it: `refuse step=ini code_obj=1`) is proof 1b's stand-in for the movie's
engine object. With it, stage (b) reads and checks stage (c)'s ids too (`step=channel_ids ...` at load), as the root
check needs them. The plugin sets `root.BGSCodeObj` to a function object carrying one function per name in
`CodeObjNames` (empty: `PlaySound,HideMenu`; 1 to 16 names of letters, digits and `_`, none twice, else
`refuse step=ini code_obj_names=`). It tries right after the engine's `LoadMovie` returns (`when=load`; proof 1b's
first run found no root there), after the engine's own `kShow` (`when=show`) and after each `kUpdate` (`when=update`),
which the key thread sends about every half second while the stand-in is not set, up to 40 tries per movie. The
first five tries and the one that sets it log
`step=code_obj when= try= root_of= get_variable= root= root_type= holder_type= set= of= read_back= names=`. Each
call logs `step=code_call n= name= args= arg0=` and, since S1-c, `arg1=` to `arg3=` for each further argument (a
string's first 64 characters; a boolean or a number after `#`, `#true`, `#2`; else its type, `type<n>`; `arg0=none`
with no argument), up to 256 calls, and does nothing else: no sound, and
`HideMenu` leaves the menu open. With `CodeObjHide=1` (with `CodeObj=1` only, else `refuse step=ini code_obj_hide=1`)
`HideMenu` also closes our menu on the main thread, as the CLOSE button and F10 do: `step=close n= by=hide_menu`.
With `CodeObjSound=1` (with `CodeObj=1` and `PlaySound` among the names only, else
`refuse step=ini code_obj_sound=1`; at load `step=code_obj_sound folder=FO4SFPipboyMenuSounds max_playing=4`)
`PlaySound` also plays the player's own converted file `FO4SFPipboyMenuSounds\<arg0>.wav` beside the dll (proof 1d,
route S2): PCM 16 bit `RIFF`/`WAVE`, 1 or 2 channels, 8000 to 192000 Hz, 32 MB at most, the name 1 to 64 letters,
digits and `_`. Each sound plays on a Windows audio (waveOut) stream and a thread of its own, so overlapping sounds mix
and closing the menu does not cut one; at most 4 at once. It logs `step=sound n= name= result=start rate= channels=
ms= playing=` and `result=end took_ms=`, or one of `missing`, `bad_size`, `unreadable`, `not_riff_wave`, `no_fmt`,
`not_pcm16`, `bad_format`, `no_data`, `open_failed`, `write_failed`, `bad_name`, `busy`, `no_thread` (up to 64 lines).
With `CodeObjInit=<name>` (with `CodeObj=1` only, 1 to 64 letters, digits and `_`, else
`refuse step=ini code_obj_init=`; proof 2a) the plugin, once the stand-in is built with all its functions and whether
or not `root.BGSCodeObj` took it (a page's root is a sealed class that takes no new member), calls the movie's own
`root.<name>` with the stand-in as its one argument, as a page's shell would, reads `root.codeObj` back, and logs
`step=code_obj_init when= try= name= got= found= type= called= result_type= code_obj= code_obj_type=`. A call that went
through ends the tries for that movie. With `CodeObjProbe=<path>,...` (with `CodeObj=1` only, 1 to 16 paths of
letters, digits, `_` and `.`, else `refuse step=ini code_obj_probe=`; proof 2b step i) the plugin, once per movie on the
try that finished the hand-over, reads each path from the movie's root with `GetMember` and logs
`step=code_obj_probe n= name= found= type= value=` (the value only for a boolean or a number; `type=-1` when the path
was not found). It sets and calls nothing. With `CodeObjCalls=<path>,...` (same rules, else
`refuse step=ini code_obj_calls=`; proof 2b step ii) each path that is a function is called once with no arguments,
on the same try and before the probe, and logged as `step=code_obj_root_call n= name= found= type= called=
result_type=`.
It does not follow the game's volume sliders. The folder is the player's, made by hand on the PC; no installer here
writes or removes it, and nothing of it enters Git.

S1-c (FAL-819; with `CodeObj=1` only, each refused otherwise; at load `step=code_obj_shell at= pages= shell_keys=`):
- `CodeObjAt=<path>` (one path, as `CodeObjCalls=`, else `refuse step=ini code_obj_at=`) also sets the stand-in as
  `<path>.BGSCodeObj` and reads it back; the hand-over (and with it the calls and the probe) is done only once that
  read-back holds, so the show and update tries go on while the path is not there yet. The `step=code_obj` line ends
  `at= at_set= at_read_back=`. For the Fallout 4 shell: `CodeObjAt=Menu_mc`.
- `CodeObjPages=1` (with `CodeObjAt=` and `onNewPage` and `onNewTab` among the names, else
  `refuse step=ini code_obj_pages=1`) answers the movie's `onNewPage(<index>)` and `onNewTab(<index>)` as its engine
  would (**a reading**): noted inside the call and, at the menu's next `kUpdate` (which the key thread sends at once),
  `<CodeObjAt>.DataObj.CurrentPage` or `.CurrentTab` set to the index (0 to 63), read back, then
  `<CodeObjAt>.InvalidateData()` called once: `step=code_answer n= page= tab= data= page_set= tab_set= page_now=
  tab_now= invalidate_found= invalidated=` (`-1`: not asked; up to 512 per movie). A first argument that is not an
  index logs `step=code_answer name= result=bad_index args=`.
- `ShellKeys=<key>:<path>,...` (1 to 8; the key a Windows virtual-key code `0x01` to `0xFE`, not `Key`, none twice;
  the path as `CodeObjCalls=`; else `refuse step=ini shell_keys=`) reads those keys every 30 ms while the menu is open
  and the game in front. A press (not a hold) calls the path with no arguments on the menu's thread at the next
  `kUpdate`, after the hand-over: `step=shell_key n= vk= path= found= called=`. The keys are read beside the game, not
  taken from it: whether the game also acts on them depends on `Flags=` (stages (d) and (e) open with `0x19`), the
  PC's finding. It reads the keyboard only: a gamepad's LB and RB do not reach the movie at stage (b).

### PASS at (c), `Stage=3` (steps: `docs/spikes/pipboy-channel-bridge-session.md`)

1. Everything in (b), with `stage=3` and `step=ready stage=c`, after `step=load_c flag_sets=0x0,0x8,0x9
   snapshot_key=0x7a click_call=none` and, before `step=ready`, `step=channel_ids value_functions=sfse_equal
   rtti_names=ok`.
2. **Text field in:** `step=movie_root ... root_type=.?AVMovieRoot@AS3@GFx@Scaleform@@`, then `step=field n=0 root=1
   field=1 set=1 read_back=1 match=yes text="X ... Y ... Z ... CLICKS 0"`, and further `step=field n=<k>` lines with
   changing numbers while the player moves with the menu open. The screenshot shows the line inside the green box. The
   control: the console's `player.getpos x`, `y` and `z` give the same numbers to the first decimal.
3. **Click out:** `step=listen root=1 button=1 function_type=<t> added=1 event=click`, then one `step=click n=1` per
   click on CLICK, and the next `step=field` reads `CLICKS 1`. The control: a click beside the button logs no
   `step=click`.
4. **Pause and input:** a `step=snapshot` line at `show`, `open`, `hide`, `main_after_open`, `main_after_close` and on
   each F11, for each flag set (opens 1 to 3: `set=0`, `1`, `2`). This stage records them; it passes or fails nothing
   on its own. Its controls are F11 in play with no menu, and F11 with the game's own pause menu open (Esc).
5. **Click to quest** (`ClickCall=FOCC_B0.Click`, its own launch): `step=load_c ... click_call=FOCC_B0.Click`,
   `step=object name=GameVM`, `step=object name=VirtualMachine ... dispatch_static_call=<rva>`, then per click on CLICK
   one `step=click n=<k>` and one `step=dispatch n=<k> call=FOCC_B0.Click queued=1`, and in `focc.0.log` one
   `b0 click` line per dispatch. The control: no `b0 click` line before the first click, none for the click beside
   the button.

### PASS at (d), `Stage=4` (the owner's card: `docs/spikes/pipboy-stat-page-owner-card.md`)

1. Everything in (b), with `stage=4` and `step=ready stage=d`, after `step=load_d flag_sets=0x9 snapshot_key=0x7a`
   and, before `step=ready`, `step=channel_ids value_functions=sfse_equal rtti_names=ok` and `step=page_ids
   data_handler=sfse_equal lookup_by_id=sfse_equal`; 34 `step=id` lines.
2. At the first open: `step=page_strings self_test=ok`, `step=page_actor_values ... get_actor_value_slot=0x01`,
   `step=object name=TESDataHandler`, `step=page_form_arrays ...` and `step=page_forms lookup=by_form_id
   known=GameHour:38:form=1:type=.?AVTESGlobal@@:...:used ...`, each of the five `used`; `step=page_globals from=0x28
   ...` and `step=page_globals value_at=<offset>`; then `step=listen name=fo4sfTabButton ...
   added=1` and `step=listen name=fo4sfCloseButton ... added=1`.
3. **Lines follow the game:** `step=page ... fields=8/8 set=8 match=8` lines whose `text=` changes with the game:
   `TIME` minutes move while the page is open, `HEALTH` after damage, `CELL` after the player crosses a cell or a door,
   `POSITION` and `DAYS PASSED` on tab 2. The controls (console, PC helper only): `player.getav health`,
   `player.getav carryweight`, `player.getlevel`, `player.getpos x` (`getglobalvalue gamehour` answers "not found for parameter Global" in
   this console; use `getglobalvalue 00000039` for days passed and `00000038` for the hour, PC run 11 Nov; TIME's minutes also move).
4. **NEXT TAB:** each click logs `step=click button=tab` and the next `step=page` shows the other tab (`tab=1` and
   `TAB 2 OF 2: DATA`, then back).
5. **CLOSE:** `step=click button=close`, `step=close ... by=button was_open=1 sent=hide`, `step=state ... open=0
   expected=0 match=yes`; F10 then opens the page again.
6. `RADS NOT INSTALLED` without the rads probe; with it (FAL-213), `RADS <n>` equal to `player.getav FO4SF_Rads`.

### PASS at (e), `Stage=5` (the owner's card: `docs/spikes/pipboy-page-kit-owner-card.md`)

1. Everything in (b), with `stage=5` and `step=ready stage=e`. Before it come:
   - `step=load_e flag_sets=0x19 pause=0 snapshot_key=0x7a click_call=none` (`flag_sets=0x1b pause=1` with `Pause=1`);
   - six `step=kit_keys` lines and seven `step=page_def` lines;
   - `step=pages pages=7 tabs=5 signature="FO4SF KIT 1 16 STAT,INV,DATA,MAP,RADIO"`;
   - `step=channel_ids` and `step=page_ids` as at (d), with 34 `step=id` lines.
2. At the first open:
   - stage (d)'s `step=page_strings self_test=ok`, `step=page_actor_values ... get_actor_value_slot=0x01`,
     `step=page_forms`, `step=page_globals from=0x28 ...` and `step=page_globals value_at=<offset>`;
   - `step=kit_movie ... match=yes`;
   - `step=listen name=root ... added=1` and `step=listen name=fo4sfClose ... button=1 ... added=1`;
   - `step=kit n=1 update=0 show=1 ... missing=0`, with `match` equal to `changed`.
3. **Keys:** `step=kit_key vk=0x53 action=down ... moved=1` and the like. The next `step=kit` line shows the bar on
   the next row (`bar=<n>`, the `>` in `rows=`). D shows `page=STAT/SPECIAL`, with seven `step=kit_av av:2c2` ...
   `av:2c8` lines, each `:used`, and seven numbers equal to `player.getav strength` ... `player.getav luck`.
4. **Scrolling:** on DATA / KIT TEST, holding S takes `rows=` past `TEST ROW 16` with the bar still on screen, and
   it stops at `TEST ROW 30`.
5. **Clicks:** `step=kit_click ... target=1 name=fo4sfRowHit<i>` (or another of that row's names) `action=row ...
   moved=1`, and `name=fo4sfTab3` or `fo4sfTabHit3` `action=tab` for MAP.
6. **CLOSE:** `step=click button=close`, `step=close ... sent=hide` and `step=state ... match=yes`. F10 then opens the
   page where it was left.
7. **Tab and Esc (FAL-414, the menu's own cancel handling):** with the page open, each of Tab and Esc logs
   `step=input id=<hex> user_event="<name>" value=1 held=0 status=0 cancel=1`, then `step=close n=<k> by=cancel
   was_open=1 sent=hide` and `step=state n=<k> open=0 expected=0 match=yes`; the game's pause menu does not appear.
   `step=input_vtable replaced=0x01,0x08 ...` follows `step=ready`. F10 and CLOSE still close it (`by=button`). With
   the page closed, Tab and Esc are the unmodded game's. If the pause menu still comes up, post the `step=input`
   lines (the ids and user events the game sends; `cancel=0` on a Tab or Esc press means `CancelCode1` to
   `CancelCode4` in the ini do not match: put the logged `id=` there) and what you saw.

### Tab and Esc close the page (FAL-414)

At stages (d) and (e) the menu copies the ten-slot BSInputEventUser vtable (subobject 0x10 of IMenu, RVA 0x4d7e950 in
1.16.244, checked by `CheckVtable`) and replaces [01] ShouldHandleEvent and [08] OnButtonEvent (both called with
`this = menu + 0x10`). While the page is open, a keyboard button whose id is in `CancelCode1..4` or whose user event is
`Cancel` is ours: [01] says so, [08] sets the event's `status = kStop` (the other menus' [01] refuses a stopped event)
and, on the press (`value > 0`, `heldDownSecs == 0`), the key thread closes the menu as CLOSE does (`by=cancel`).
Everything else goes to the engine's own slots. One press arrives as several events (`held=0`, `0.009`, `0.017`): only
the first closes the menu, and the next close waits for a release (the gate is cleared at every open and close, since a release can be heard while the page is closed). PC game run of c1d1d899: Esc (`id=0x1b
user_event="Cancel"`) is taken and the pause menu does not open; Tab (`id=0x9 user_event="DataMenu"`) closed the page but
the game's data menu still opened at flag set `0x9`, since `kStop` does not stop its opener; at `0x19` Tab arrives as `Cancel`, the stack is `contexts=[0,1,78,13]` and no data menu opens (PC run, #738). Diagnostic for that: the snapshot key (F11) also
logs `step=menu_detail name=<menu> menu=<addr> flags=... c4=... c8=... cc=... d0=...` for every known menu that is open,
and every snapshot already logs the ControlMap's active input context ids (`contexts=`); run it with our page, the data
menu and the pause menu open.

### What each failure line means

| Line | Meaning | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step=off` | `Stage` is not 1 to 5 in the ini next to the dll | set it |
| `refuse step=version` | the runtime is not 1.16.244.0 | nothing to do on that runtime |
| `refuse step=ini key=` | `Key` is 0 or above 0xFE | fix the ini |
| `refuse step=image` | the game image does not look like a PE32+ executable | report |
| `refuse step=address_library reason=missing` | the bin file is not next to the dll | install it |
| `refuse step=address_library reason=header` | wrong format, version or pointer size | the 1.16.244.0 format 5 file is needed |
| `refuse step=id ... reason=...` | an id is beyond the file, zero, outside the image, or libxse gives another offset | `NEEDS-PC lookup <id>` |
| `refuse step=rtti` | a vtable id does not name an IMenu vtable at that subobject offset | the vtable ids are stale: look them up again |
| `refuse step=slots` | a slot is not the function its id names, or LoadMovie is not SFSE's hook address | the precedent's function ids are stale |
| `refuse step=ctor` | the constructor id does not load the primary vtable | the constructor id is stale |
| `refuse step=listen` | SFSE gave no messaging or task interface | report the SFSE version |
| `refuse step=register reason=name_taken` / `not_taken` / `no_ui` | the menu name is in use, the engine did not take our registration, or no UI singleton | report the log |
| `refuse step=key_thread` | the key thread could not start | report |
| `refuse step=toggle n=<n> reason=no_ui_or_queue` | the key was pressed before the UI or its message queue existed; nothing was sent | press again once in play; report if it repeats |
| `refuse step=create reason=out_of_memory` | allocation failed on open | report |
| `step=create ... vtables=UNEXPECTED` | the constructor set other vtables than the checked ones | stop: the layout differs |
| `step=create ... rtti=UNEXPECTED` | the slot before our object's primary vtable is not the engine's IMenu locator | stop before the next press: the engine's cast will read it |
| the log ends after `step=message ... type=show`, and the picture freezes | the engine's work after the show did not return (at `b3f352b7`: its cast on an object without a locator) | take a hang dump: each thread's instruction pointer as module plus offset, and the stack of the thread that created the menu |
| `step=state ... match=no` | the menu did not open or close as asked | read the `step=message` lines around it |
| `step=load_movie ... result=0` | (b): the engine's loader did not take our movie | check that the plugin is active and the archive is named after it. Then try the variant with an empty ActionScript 3 document class (the generator gains it then) |
| the log ends without `step=destroy` after a close, then a crash | the engine freed or used our object differently | collect the crash log; try `KeepAlive=1` if it was 0 |
| `refuse step=ini snapshot_key=` | (c): `SnapshotKey` above 0xFE or equal to `Key` | fix the ini |
| `refuse step=channel_ids name=GFx.Value.<f> rva=<r> sfse_rva=<s>` | (c): libxse's id for a Scaleform Value function is not SFSE 0.2.21's address | stop: one of the two is stale for this runtime |
| `refuse step=channel_ids name=<x>.RTTI type=<t>` | (c): an RTTI id does not name its type | the id is stale: look it up again |
| `refuse step=object name=<x> ... (its reads stay off)` | (c): a singleton is not its type; that reading logs `?` from then on | report the type the line names |
| `refuse step=channel what=movie_root ...` or `what=root_slots` | (c): the movie's root is not an ActionScript 3 MovieRoot, or its slots leave the image; no Scaleform call is made for the rest of the session | report the types the line names |
| `step=listen ... button=0` or `step=field ... field=0` | (c): `getChildByName` did not find the child | the movie needs a document class that declares its children (the generator gains it then) |
| `step=field ... set=1 read_back=1 match=yes` but no text on screen | (c): the field took the text and the embedded font did not draw | screenshot; the font is the next item |
| `step=listen ... added=1` but no `step=click` on a click | (c): the click did not reach the movie (no cursor or no mouse input to our menu) | compare the flag sets' opens: the cursor bit is set 1 |
| `step=field ... text="NO POSITION ..."` | (c): the player singleton was not readable as a PlayerCharacter | read the `step=object name=PlayerCharacter` line |
| `refuse step=ini click_call=` | (c): `ClickCall` is not `<script>.<function>` with two Papyrus names | fix the ini, or empty it |
| `refuse step=object name=GameVM ...` or `name=VirtualMachine ... (no click reaches a script)` | (c): the VM singleton or the VM it holds is not its type, or its vtable leaves the image; no click is dispatched for the rest of the session | report the types the line names |
| `step=dispatch ... result=no_vm` | (c): no script VM yet when the click came | click again once in play |
| `step=dispatch ... queued=0` | (c): the VM did not take the call: the script or the function is unknown to it | check `compile_b0.txt` and that the kit was staged at this head; `Papyrus.0.log` names it |
| `queued=1` but no `b0 click` in `focc.0.log` | (c): the VM took the call and did not run it, or the probe quest is missing (`b0 refused quest=none`) | collect `Papyrus.0.log` |
| the game stops at the first click after `step=dispatch` was due | (c): slot 0x2F is not `DispatchStaticCall` on 1.16.244 | remove the dll; report the crash log's module and offset |
| `refuse step=page_ids name=<TESDataHandler.Singleton or TESForm.LookupByID> rva=<r> sfse_rva=<s>` | (d): a libxse id is not SFSE 0.2.21's address; the plugin stays idle | stop: one of the two is stale for this runtime |
| `refuse step=page what=strings ...` | (d): our own menu name did not read back through the pool-string reader: no editor ID or name is read, every such line is `?` | report the line (it shows what was read) |
| `refuse step=page what=actor_value_owner ...` or `what=get_actor_value ... slot0=... target0=... destructor=...` | (d): the player's ActorValueOwner was not found or its slot 0x00 is not the thunk to the destructor; every actor value is `?` | report the line: its slots and targets settle libxse's against SFSE's declaration |
| `refuse step=object name=TESDataHandler ...` | (d): the data handler is not its type; only the form-list log is skipped | report the line |
| `step=page_forms ... known=...:refused` or `avif_typed=0` | (d): that fixed form id gave no form (`form=0`) or another type (`type=`); its line prints `?`. `rads=not_installed` is `RADS NOT INSTALLED` | report the line; `avif_ids=` lists what the ids hold |
| `step=page_globals from=0x28 ...` but no `value_at=` | (d): no slot from +0x30 holds both globals in range and in step: `TIME ?`, `DAYS PASSED ?` | post the line whole: its hex and floats show where the value is |
| `step=page_unknown what=<value> reason=<r>` | (d): one value could not be read, once per kind; its line shows `?` | report the line |
| `step=page ... fields=0/8` | (d): `getChildByName` found none of the page's fields: the movie is not the `--page` one | re-stage with `--page` |
| `step=listen name=<button> ... added=1` but no `step=click` on a click | (d): the click did not reach the movie | read `step=flags`: the page needs `0x9` |
| `refuse step=pages line=<n> reason=<r> (the kit stays off)` | (e): line n of the ini is not a page line the kit reads | `python scripts/ui/make_pipboy_kit.py --check --ini <that ini>` names the problem |
| `refuse step=ini kit_key=<action> ...` | (e): one of that action's keys is 0, above 0xFE, `Key` or `SnapshotKey` | fix the ini |
| `step=kit_movie ... match=no` | (e): the movie was staged from other pages than those beside the dll | re-stage with `--kit` from the installed ini |
| `step=kit ... missing=<n>` | (e): n names were not found: the movie is not the kit's | re-stage with `--kit` |
| `step=kit ... changed=<c> match=<m>`, m below c | (e): a `text` or a `visible` did not read back; it is set again on the next update | report the line (`visible` is new at this stage) |
| `step=listen name=root ... added=0` | (e): no listener on the root, so clicks do nothing; the keys still work | report the line |
| `step=kit_click ... target=0` or `name=-` | (e): the click's event had no target or no name | report: one listener per object is the fallback |
| `step=kit_av av:<id>:...:refused` | (e): that form id gave no `ActorValueInfo`; its row prints `?` | report the line |

The probe changes no Starfield interface file, and nothing it makes goes into Git: no dll, no movie, no archive.
