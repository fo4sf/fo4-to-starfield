# Pip-Boy: rebuilding Fallout 4's own Pip-Boy in Starfield (plan, FAL-614)

Claude (sole survivor), 13 Nov 2026. **A plan, no code.** Labels as in the other plans: **verified** = read from our
source or a PC log, **hypothesis** = to be proven by the read named beside it. The pause default (`Pause=0`) does not
change.

## The direction (owner, 13 Nov, FAL-614)

- Rebuild the Fallout 4 Pip-Boy in Starfield: its screen movies, map page, fonts and images, later the device on the
  arm. Do it by **converting the player's own installed copy on their PC at install time**, as the world's meshes and
  textures are converted. It is not a look-alike drawn by us.
- Converted game files never go into Git, a release, a task, a comment or a receipt. Only the converter goes into Git
  (`docs/research/framework/findings/legal-policy.md`, point 1).
- One Pip-Boy, one set of functions, one data feed. Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4 and 76, and later others, are
  selectable **looks** on top of it. Fallout 4 is the first look.
- Travel from the map (fast travel, moving between maps) is **not designed here**; it is the owner's later decision.
  Fallout 76's map style and extra Pip-Boy features are function, and also later.
- The kit's text rows stay as the debug view. The text map of our converted cells is **parked** for later uses (a
  warfare mode, settlement management views). It is a separate, later page, not the Pip-Boy's map page; its groundwork
  is held on `claude/fal614-pipboy-text-map` (`3133640d`).

## (a) What the files are, and what Starfield loads

**What we load today (verified, source).**
- The plugin registers its own menu and loads `Interface/FO4SF_PipboyMenu.swf` from our archive through the engine's
  `IMenu::LoadMovie` (`sfse/FO4SFPipboyMenu/src/main.cpp`, `kLoadMovieRva`).
- Starfield's player runs it as an ActionScript 3 movie: the plugin accepts the movie's root only when its RTTI is
  `MovieRoot@AS3@GFx@Scaleform` (`kMovieRootRtti`).
- Our movie is built by `scripts/ui/make_pipboy_kit.py`: CWS (zlib), SWF version 12, the AS3 bit set in
  `FileAttributes`, and **no ActionScript at all**. The plugin drives it from outside: `getChildByName`,
  `addEventListener` on a click, and `SetMember` of `text` and `visible`.
- Starfield's own `almanacmenu.swf` is also CWS version 12 (`ui-pipboy-vats.md`, item 1).

**What Fallout 4's files are (hypothesis, read D1 settles it).**

| File (in `Fallout4 - Interface.ba2`) | What it is expected to be |
| --- | --- |
| `PipboyMenu.swf` | the shell: the frame, the tab bar, the bottom bar, and the loader of each tab's movie |
| `Pipboy_StatsPage.swf`, `Pipboy_InvPage.swf`, `Pipboy_DataPage.swf`, `Pipboy_MapPage.swf`, `Pipboy_RadioPage.swf` | one movie per tab, loaded into the shell |
| `PipboyMessageBox.swf` | the in-Pip-Boy confirmation box |
| `pipboybootsequence.swf` | the boot animation shown when the Pip-Boy first opens |
| `fonts_en.swf` | the shared fonts the other movies import by name, with `FontConfig.txt` mapping font names |

- All are expected to be AS3 Scaleform movies, CWS, with a SWF version near ours.
- They are expected to carry ActionScript (`DoABC` tags) that expects things from Fallout 4's engine:
  - a code object the engine puts on the menu (sounds, tab changes, closing);
  - the Pip-Boy's data, pushed as a tree of named values (player info, inventory, quests, map, radio). This is the
    same tree the Fallout 4 companion app received.
- What each movie imports from `fonts_en.swf`, and which classes it defines, is what D1 prints.

**Read on the PC (D1, 13 Nov, at `c28a8d5d`, the script unchanged; PR #764 comment 6840521845): verified.**
- All nine files were found. Each is `CWS` **version 15**, ActionScript 3, with **one `DoABC`** each: the pages hold
  37 to 119 kB of it, the boot sequence only 2,203 bytes.
- Stage 876 x 700 (the boot sequence 826 x 700), 30 frames a second.
- Each imports only `fonts_en.swf`. No Scaleform tag of code 1000 and up, so no image file is named inside the movies.
- Starfield's two files: version 12, ActionScript 3, 1920 x 1080.
- So route A is open in principle: the same script generation on both sides, with the version (15 against 12) the
  first difference to watch. D2 is needed for the pages. The boot sequence, with the least code, stays proof 1.

## (b) The routes, and what proves or kills each

**Route A: load the converted original movies, feed them what they expect.**
- **How it works.**
  - The PC's install step reads the player's movies from their archive and writes them, with only the conversion the
    load needs (for example the SWF version byte, or import paths), into a private archive beside ours.
  - Our plugin loads the shell instead of our kit movie. It then plays Fallout 4's engine: it supplies the code
    object's functions and pushes the data tree in the shape the movies read.
- **Proves it.** The converted `pipboybootsequence.swf` (no data needed) plays in our menu, and the plugin's log shows
  the movie root accepted, with no ActionScript error.
- **Kills it.** Any of these:
  - the movie does not load;
  - Starfield's player refuses or faults on Fallout 4's ActionScript;
  - the movies need a native class from Fallout 4's executable that Starfield's player does not have.
- **Cost if it lives.** The data tree: every page reads its own names. The plugin must learn them from the movies'
  own class and member names (D1, D2), never by copying their code into Git.

**Route B: rebuild each page in our own movie from the original's parts, extracted on the PC.**
- **How it works.**
  - The install step reads the player's movies on the PC and copies the shapes, images, fonts and placements of a
    page into our kit movie. The kit generator already writes these tag kinds.
  - Our named fields go where the original's text sits. The plugin keeps feeding our fields exactly as it does today,
    so no Fallout 4 ActionScript runs.
- **Proves it.** Our menu shows the original STAT page's frame and font, with live HP from our plugin in it.
- **Kills it.** The page's look is built by its ActionScript at run time (lists filled, text created, layout computed)
  rather than placed on its timeline, so the copied parts come out empty or broken.
- **Cost.** Each page's layout is ours to keep in step with the original's pieces. Animations that the original's
  code drives are lost.

**Expected outcome (hypothesis).** A mix: the static frame, fonts and images come by route B; pages whose look is made
by their code need route A or a rebuild of that code's behaviour in our plugin. The first proof below decides route A
early, because it costs nothing to try.

## (c) The map page

**Where its parts live (hypothesis, read D3 settles it).**
- The map page's movie is `Pipboy_MapPage.swf`. The look survey found it in the player's `Fallout4 - Interface.ba2`
  (#759, PC run 12 Nov).
- The marker icons are expected to be symbols inside that movie (one per marker type).
- The world map image is expected to be a texture under `Textures\Interface\` (a `.dds`). It is named by the worldspace
  record, or found by a name holding `map`. The MAP plan's R5 lists those names.

**Read on the PC (D3, 13 Nov): verified.**
- The worldspace `Commonwealth`: `ICON` = `Interface\Pip-Boy\WorldMap_d.dds`, 2048 x 2048, BC1, 12 mips.
- `MNAM`: usable size 0 x 0; north-west cell (-33, 25), south-east cell (28, -36): 62 x 62 Fallout 4 cells.
  `ONAM`: scale 1, offsets 0. `NAM0` / `NAM9`: -393216 / 393216.
- So, as a **hypothesis** for the map card: the image spans those 62 cells of 4096 units. A Fallout 4 position (x, y)
  falls at pixel ((x / 4096 + 33) / 62 x 2048, (25 + 1 - y / 4096) / 62 x 2048), the south-east cell included. The
  first map card checks it against one marker the player can see on both maps.
- `Pipboy_MapPage.swf` holds 92 marker symbol classes. A separate `Interface\MapMarkers.swf` also exists; D2 below
  reads its names with the others.

**What our page must supply.** These come from the Fallout 4 data tree's map branch (hypothesis: the companion app's
`Map` → `World` values):

| Value | From us |
| --- | --- |
| The player's x, y | POSITION, back in Fallout 4's frame: (Starfield metres − the merge offset) × 70. The merge offset is `vmad_patch.MERGE_MEASURED`, and the core is built at Fallout 4 position / 70 (`core64c.md`) |
| The player's rotation | HEADING (FAL-595: `HeadingAt=88`, compass degrees, verified on the PC) |
| The map's extents (the world corners the image spans) | from the worldspace record of the player's own `Fallout4.esm`, read at install time |
| Markers: x, y, name, type, discovered | our converted markers (the marker conversion, MAP plan step 3), their discovered flag once read R3 and R4 find it |
| Which world the player is in | WORLD and GRID (FAL-595); indoors there is no world map, as in Fallout 4 |

The local map (Fallout 4 draws it from the scene at run time) and travel are not in this plan.

## (d) The reads the PC runs first (names and header fields only)

Environment: the owner's PC, PowerShell, the repository checkout at this branch's head, Python as for the look survey.
No game launch, nothing written under the Fallout 4 or Starfield folders.

The script reads each file **in memory** from the archive with `src/fo4sf/ba2.py` and prints only:
- the header: signature, version, length, stage size, frame rate, frame count;
- the `FileAttributes` flags;
- the count of each tag code;
- names: `SymbolClass` class names, `ExportAssets` names, `ImportAssets2` URLs and names, the `DoABC` name, and font
  names;
- the file names that Scaleform's own tags (code 1000 and up) refer to.

No shape, image, sound or code is written anywhere.

**D1 (movies).** For each of `PipboyMenu.swf`, `Pipboy_StatsPage.swf`, `Pipboy_InvPage.swf`, `Pipboy_DataPage.swf`,
`Pipboy_MapPage.swf`, `Pipboy_RadioPage.swf`, `PipboyMessageBox.swf`, `pipboybootsequence.swf`, `fonts_en.swf` (in
`Fallout4 - Interface.ba2`), print the lines below. If a name is not found, check the survey's spelling. Print the same
for two Starfield files for comparison: `interface/almanacmenu.swf` and `interface/fonts_en.swf` (in
`Starfield - Interface.ba2`).

**D2 (data names; needed, D1 found `DoABC` in every movie).** The names the movies' ActionScript uses: classes,
members, and the names of the data the engine sends. It prints the ABC's version and its constant pool of strings,
filtered to identifiers (letters, digits, `_`, `$`, `.` and `:`, at most 64 characters). No code, no bytes, no
sentences. Run it on the same nine files as D1 plus `MapMarkers.swf`, in memory as D1:

The output stays in the PC's private evidence folder. Send back, per file, the `abc=` line and the count of names, and
for `PipboyMenu.swf`, `Pipboy_StatsPage.swf` and `pipboybootsequence.swf` the names themselves. The STAT page's names
are the data proof 2 must feed; the boot sequence's are what proof 1 may ask the engine for.

**D3 (the world map).**
- The look survey's names-only listing over `Fallout4 - Textures*.ba2` and `Fallout4 - Interface.ba2`, for names
  holding `map` (the MAP plan's R5).
- For each hit, the DDS header only: width, height, format, mip count.
- The worldspace record `Commonwealth` in the player's `Fallout4.esm`: the names of its subrecords and the map-related
  ones' sizes (`MNAM`, `NAM3`, `NAM4`, `ICON` if present). No values beyond what names the map image and its extents.

## (e) The smallest first proof a player can see

The owner PC suggested the boot sequence or the STAT page's frame with live HP. Weighed:

| Proof | Needs | Tells us |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. `pipboybootsequence.swf`, converted, playing inside our menu** | D1; a private converted copy; the plugin loading a second movie name from the ini (one setting) | Whether Starfield's player runs Fallout 4's ActionScript at all: route A alive or dead, with no data feed to build first |
| 2. The original STAT page's frame and font around our live HP | D1 (and D2 if route A); route B's extraction of one page, or route A's data tree for HP | The first page a player would call the real Pip-Boy |

**Recommendation: proof 1 first, then proof 2.** Proof 1 is the cheapest test that decides between the routes, and a
player sees the real boot screen. Proof 2 follows by whichever route proof 1 leaves standing.
- If the boot sequence plays: proof 2 is route A, the shell with the STAT page and the HP value pushed by name.
- If it does not: proof 2 is route B, the STAT frame's shapes and font copied into our kit movie on the PC.

**Proof 1, the card (owner PC; the plugin's `Movie=` setting, FAL-614).** Environment: the owner's PC, the plugin
built from this branch's head, the probe staged as for `Stage=2`. Nothing of the player's goes into Git.
1. Stage the probe as usual (`make_pipboy_probe.py stage`). Before packing, copy the player's own
   `Interface\pipboybootsequence.swf`, read from their `Fallout4 - Interface.ba2`, unchanged, into the staged
   `Data\Interface\` as `FO4SF_Fo4Boot.swf`. Install with the one extra movie named:
   `pipboy_probe_install.py install --dir <stage> --extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Boot --starfield <game>`. Without
   `--extra-movie` the installer refuses it as a twin that is not our movie; with it, it checks only the name and that
   the file is a whole SWF (signature, FileLength, every tag's length; no tag's contents), packs it into the probe archive and `uninstall` removes it with that archive. This
   private archive stays on the PC.
2. In `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini`: `Stage=2`, `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Boot`.
3. Load a save outdoors, press F10, wait 5 seconds, take a screenshot, press F10 again.

PASS: `step=movie name=FO4SF_Fo4Boot`, `step=load_movie ... result=1 movie=<non-zero> movie_name=FO4SF_Fo4Boot
name_asks=<1 or more>`, and the screenshot shows Fallout 4's boot screen inside our menu, with no crash.
What each other outcome means:
- `name_asks=0`: the engine does not name the file after `GetName` in that call. Whatever loaded, the setting's
  hypothesis is wrong; send the log.
- `result=0` with `name_asks` of 1 or more: the engine refused the file. The next card converts it, the SWF version
  15 to 12 first.
- It loads but shows nothing, or freezes: its ActionScript waits for something of Fallout 4's engine. D2's boot names
  say what.
- A crash: send the crash log; the next card is the version conversion.

**Proof 1, the result (owner PC, 13 Nov, 02:46 to 02:50 UTC, at `2db64a83`): PASS, verified.** The player's own
`pipboybootsequence.swf`, unchanged, installed with `--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Boot`; `Stage=2`, `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Boot`.
- The log: `step=movie name=FO4SF_Fo4Boot`, then `step=load_movie ... result=1 movie=<non-zero>
  movie_name=FO4SF_Fo4Boot name_asks=2`. The `GetName` hypothesis holds.
- On screen: Fallout 4's boot text types itself out in its font over the game view; the header and seven lines stand
  at 16 seconds. F10 closed it; no crash, nothing left installed.
- **Route A is alive:** Starfield's player runs this version 15 movie with its ActionScript 3 as it is. No version
  conversion was needed for this file.
- Not seen: sound (the movie asks for `PlaySound`); whether the timeline reaches its end and `HideMenu` (frame 371 is
  about 12.4 seconds at 30 fps; the text still stood at 16 seconds); framing and scale against Fallout 4's own; the
  movie has no background of its own and draws over the game.

**What Fallout 4's movies ask of the engine (D2's names; a reading, not verified).**
- Each movie reaches its engine through one object, `BGSCodeObj`, by `Shared:BGSExternalInterface`'s `call`. The
  boot sequence names two of its functions, `PlaySound` and `HideMenu`. Proof 1 ran with no such object and did not
  fail, so `call` is expected to skip a missing object (**hypothesis**: the PASS shows no fault, not how it skips).
- The STAT page and the shell name more: the object's arrival (`InitCodeObj`, `ReleaseCodeObj`, `onCodeObjCreate`,
  `onCodeObjDestruction`, `bAcquiredByNativeCode`) and the data (`Pipboy_DataObj`, `PipboyChangeEvent`,
  `onPipboyChangeEvent`, `PipboyUpdateMask`), with the values by name (`CurrHP`, `MaxHP`, `CurrAP`, `MaxAP`,
  `XPLevel`, `XPProgressPct`, `HeadCondition`, ...). Which names are functions the page calls and which are values
  the engine pushes is not in D2: names only.
- The shell `PipboyMenu.swf` loads its pages by file name (`Pipboy_StatsPage.swf` and the others) through
  `PipboyLoader`. In Starfield those names are not under `Interface/`, so the shell alone would show its frame and no
  page. Carrying the pages under their own names is a later installer change, not now.
- Every movie imports `fonts_en.swf`, and in Starfield that name is Starfield's own file. Whether the boot text's
  font is Fallout 4's or a Starfield font under the same export name is not settled.

**Proof 1b, the card: the stand-in engine object (owner PC; the plugin's `CodeObj=` setting, FAL-614).**
Environment as for proof 1, with the plugin built from this branch's head.
1. Install as for proof 1 (`--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Boot`).
2. In `FO4SFPipboyMenu.ini`: `Stage=2`, `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Boot`, `CodeObj=1`, `CodeObjNames=` empty (that is
   `PlaySound,HideMenu`).
3. Outdoors: F10, wait 20 seconds, take a screenshot, F10 again.

**First run (owner PC, 13 Nov, 03:29 to 03:34 UTC, at `f5114524`): verified.** The movie loaded and played as in
proof 1, but `step=code_obj root=0 holder_type=0 set=0 of=3 read_back=0`, logged in the same millisecond as
`load_movie result=1`; the menu's `step=state n=1 open=1` came 0.74 seconds later. No root existed on that thread right
after `LoadMovie` returned, so nothing about the holder was tested. No crash.

**The fix (this card's head):** the plugin tries again after the engine's own `kShow` (`when=show`) and after each
`kUpdate` (`when=update`). The key thread sends a `kUpdate` about every half second while the stand-in is not set, up to
40 tries per movie. The first five tries and the one that sets it are logged:
`step=code_obj when= try= root_of= get_variable= root= root_type= holder_type= set= of= read_back= names=`.

**Second run (owner PC, 13 Nov, 03:45 to 03:49 UTC, at `aadf1372`): verified.** Every try, from `when=load try=1`
to `when=update try=40` (+20.1 seconds), logged `root_of=0 get_variable=0 root=0 root_type=0`. The movie played; no
`code_call`; no crash. So it was not timing.

**The cause, read from the source (not yet confirmed by a run):** at stage 2 the plugin reads only stage a and b's
Address Library ids (`IdCount()` gave `kIdCountB`). `RootOf` compares the movie root's type with
`Address(kMovieRootRtti)`, one of stage c's ids, which stage 2 had never read. So the first try refused, once, with
`refuse step=channel what=movie_root ...`, and that turns the channel off: every later try returns at once with no
root. Stage 3, where our own movie's channel works on this PC, reads and checks those ids
(`step=channel_ids value_functions=sfse_equal rtti_names=ok`).

**The fix (this card's head):** with `CodeObj=1`, stage 2 reads and checks stage c's ids as stage 3 does. At load, the
log then shows `step=channel_ids value_functions=sfse_equal rtti_names=ok` before `step=ready stage=b`.

PASS: one `step=code_obj ... root=1 ... set=3 of=3 read_back=1 names=PlaySound,HideMenu`, with the `when=` and
`try=` that found the root. Then `step=code_call` lines, `name=PlaySound` with their `arg0`, and one `name=HideMenu`.
D2 names three `PlaySound` calls; any made before the set (the timeline starts at the load) are not seen, so fewer
than three is not a failure. That settles the object contract (functions called by name on `root.BGSCodeObj`) and
whether the timeline reaches its end. The stand-in only logs: no sound plays, and `HideMenu` leaves the menu open.
What each other outcome means:
- No try finds `root=1` (`root_of=0`: our root check refused; `get_variable=0` or `root=0`: the movie has no root
  object yet even after 40 tries): send the log; the next card reads the root another way.
- `set` below 3 or `read_back=0` with `root=1`: a function object does not take members here. The next card makes the
  holder a plain object (the root's object-creating slot, not read yet).
- `step=code_obj` passes but no `step=code_call`: the movie reads the object another way, or before our set. Send the
  log.
- A crash: send the crash log; `CodeObj=0` is proof 1 as it passed.

**Third run (owner PC, 13 Nov, 04:05 to 04:09 UTC, at `5db70734`): PASS, verified.**
- `step=movie_root ... root_type=.?AVMovieRoot@AS3@GFx@Scaleform@@`, then `step=code_obj when=load try=1 root_of=1
  get_variable=1 root=1 root_type=10 holder_type=8 set=3 of=3 read_back=1`. The diagnosis above holds.
- Calls: `PlaySound` `UIPipBoyBootSequenceA` 30 ms after the set, `...B` at +5.1 seconds, `...C` at +10.4 seconds, then
  `HideMenu` with no arguments at +15.4 seconds. With the menu left open, the movie repeats B, C and `HideMenu` every
  10.3 seconds.
- **Settled:** a function object takes members; the movie calls by name on `root.BGSCodeObj`; a set at load is early
  enough; the timeline ends in `HideMenu`.

**Proof 1c, the card: a real `HideMenu` (owner PC; the plugin's `CodeObjHide=` setting, FAL-614).** As proof 1b, with
`CodeObjHide=1` added: the stand-in's `HideMenu` still logs, and also closes our menu on the main thread, as the CLOSE
button and F10 do. Outdoors: F10, then wait 20 seconds without pressing anything.
PASS: `step=code_call ... name=HideMenu` at about +15 seconds, then `step=close n=<k> by=hide_menu was_open=1
sent=hide`, the menu gone from the screen, and no further `code_call` lines. The game stays playable; F10 opens it
again from the start. The sounds (`UIPipBoyBootSequenceA`, `B`, `C`) are the next card after this one, converted on the
PC with nothing in Git.

**Proof 1c, the result (owner PC, 13 Nov, 04:38 to 04:42 UTC, at `9550c00a`): PASS twice in one session, verified.**
`HideMenu` at +15.4 seconds, then `step=close n=4 by=hide_menu was_open=1 sent=hide` in the same millisecond; the menu
was gone from the screen at 18 seconds, with no further `code_call`. The second F10 loaded the movie again (`result=1`,
stand-in set on try 1), with the same three `PlaySound` calls and the same close at +15.4 seconds. MSVC accepts the
forward declaration of `Close`. No crash, nothing left installed.

**The boot sequence's sounds, step 1: read D4 (owner PC; names and header fields only).** The movie asks for three
sounds by name: `UIPipBoyBootSequenceA`, `B` and `C`. That these are the editor ids of sound descriptors (`SNDR`) in
the player's `Fallout4.esm` is a **hypothesis**; D4 settles it and names the files behind them.
- In the player's `Fallout4.esm`: the records whose editor id is one of the three names. For each, print the record
  type, the names of its subrecords, and the file names it lists (`ANAM` in a sound descriptor). Nothing else.
- For each file name: whether `Fallout4 - Sounds.ba2` (or another of the player's archives) holds it, and its audio
  header only: the container (`RIFF`/`WAVE` or `XWMA`), the format tag, channels, sample rate, bits per sample and
  the length in seconds. No samples.
- D4 reads in memory and writes nothing. The audio stays on the PC.

**The sounds, step 2 (written from D4's lines; a proposal, nothing built).** Two ways a converted sound can play:
- **S1, Starfield's own audio engine** (Wwise). New sounds need authored sound banks. Not proposed now.
- **S2, the plugin plays the player's converted file itself** through Windows audio, from a private folder next to
  the plugin, when the stand-in's `PlaySound` names it. It does not follow the game's volume sliders. It is the
  cheapest proof that the sounds play at the right moments, and it is the proposal for proof 1d.
- If D4 shows `XWMA`, the PC converts it to plain `WAVE` with its own tool first; no audio enters Git, a task or a
  receipt.

**Read D4, the result (owner PC, 13 Nov, at `df7e5c0f`): verified.** The hypothesis holds: three `SNDR` records,
`0CAC68`, `0CAC69` and `0CAC6A`, each with one `ANAM` naming
`data\Sound\FX\UI\PipBoy\BootSequence\UI_PipBoy_BootSequence_A.wav` (and `_B`, `_C`). `Fallout4 - Sounds.ba2`
holds them as `.xwm`: `RIFF`/`XWMA`, format tag `0x0161`, mono, 44100 Hz, 16 bit, about 5.95, 6.32 and 7.06 seconds.
With the calls at 0, +5.1 and +10.4 seconds, each sound runs about a second into the next, and C ends about 2 seconds
after the movie's `HideMenu` at +15.4. So the player must mix, not cut, and closing the menu must not stop C. A record
names `.wav` where the archive holds `.xwm`: the PC's extraction looks for the `.xwm`. No xWMA converter is on the PC
yet; a download (ffmpeg, kept on the PC) waits for the owner's yes.

**Proof 1d, the card: the three sounds by route S2.** Plugin code, so the PC rebuilds. `CodeObjSound=1` (with
`CodeObj=1` and `PlaySound` among its names only): the stand-in's `PlaySound` still logs, then plays the player's own
converted file `FO4SFPipboyMenuSounds\<arg0>.wav` beside the dll, through Windows audio (waveOut), one stream and one
thread per call, so overlapping sounds mix and closing the menu does not cut one; at most 4 at once. The file must be
PCM 16 bit `RIFF`/`WAVE` with 1 or 2 channels; anything else (an unconverted `XWMA` too) is logged and not played.
It does not follow the game's volume sliders. The steps, once the owner has said yes to the converter:
1. On the PC only: take `UI_PipBoy_BootSequence_A.xwm`, `_B` and `_C` from `Fallout4 - Sounds.ba2` and convert each to
   PCM 16 bit WAVE, named by the editor id the movie passes, into `Data\SFSE\Plugins\FO4SFPipboyMenuSounds\` beside
   the dll: `UIPipBoyBootSequenceA.wav`, `UIPipBoyBootSequenceB.wav`, `UIPipBoyBootSequenceC.wav` (for example
   `ffmpeg -i UI_PipBoy_BootSequence_A.xwm -c:a pcm_s16le UIPipBoyBootSequenceA.wav`). The folder is the player's; no
   installer here writes or removes it, and none of it enters Git, a task or a receipt.
2. Install as for proof 1c (`--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Boot`).
3. `Stage=2`, `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Boot`, `CodeObj=1`, `CodeObjHide=1`, `CodeObjSound=1`, `CodeObjNames=` empty.
4. Outdoors: F10, then wait 25 seconds without pressing anything, listening.
5. Send the `step=code_obj_sound`, `step=code_call`, `step=sound` and `step=close` lines, and say what was heard.

PASS: `step=code_obj_sound folder=FO4SFPipboyMenuSounds max_playing=4` at load; for each of A, B and C a
`step=sound ... result=start rate=44100 channels=1 ms=<about 5950, 6320, 7060>` within a few milliseconds of its
`code_call`, then `result=end`; B starts while A plays (`playing=2`); `step=close ... by=hide_menu` at about +15.4
seconds and C's `result=end` about 2 seconds after it; the three sounds heard in time with the text, the last one not
cut; no crash. Other outcomes: `missing` (the file's name or folder), `not_pcm16` or `not_riff_wave` (not converted),
`open_failed` (no audio device for that format), no `step=sound` at all (`CodeObjSound` not read: check the
`refuse` lines).

**Proof 1d, the result (owner PC, 13 Nov, 05:26 to 05:31 UTC, at `e86d2059`): PASS by the log, verified; not yet
heard.** No download was needed: the player's Fallout 4 install carries its own `xwmaencode.exe`, which converted the
three files privately (PCM 16 bit, mono, 44100 Hz; real lengths 5.15, 5.39 and 6.08 seconds, shorter than D4's
estimate). `step=code_obj_sound folder=FO4SFPipboyMenuSounds max_playing=4`; A started 86 ms after its call
(`playing=1`), B and C 8 ms after theirs (`playing=2` each: they overlap); every sound reached `result=end`
(`took_ms` 5276, 5421, 6111); `step=close by=hide_menu` at +15.36 seconds and C's end 1.15 seconds after it, so the
close did not cut C. No crash; the sounds folder was moved out again. Nobody listened: whether it sounds right is for
the owner's ear.

**Proof 2a, the card: the STAT page alone.** Plugin code (one new setting), so the PC rebuilds. D2's STAT page names
`InitCodeObj`, `codeObj` and `bAcquiredByNativeCode`, but not `HideMenu`: a page is handed its engine object by the
shell (`PipboyMenu.swf`) rather than reading `root.BGSCodeObj` itself (a reading, not verified). Loaded alone it has no
shell, so `CodeObjInit=<name>` (with `CodeObj=1` only; it ships empty) makes the plugin call `root.<name>(stand-in)`
once per movie, right after the stand-in is set, and log
`step=code_obj_init name= got= found= type= called= result_type=`. The stand-in's names below are D2's verbs on the
page, a guess at which are engine calls; 16 is the most the stand-in takes.
1. On the PC only: copy your own `Interface\Pipboy_StatsPage.swf`, unchanged, into the staged `Data\Interface\` as
   `FO4SF_Fo4Stats.swf`, and install with `--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Stats`.
2. `Stage=2`, `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Stats`, `CodeObj=1`, `CodeObjHide=0`, `CodeObjSound=0`, `CodeObjInit=InitCodeObj`,
   `CodeObjNames=PlaySound,PlayPerkSound,PlaySmallTransition,UseStimpak,UseRadaway,ToggleShowingEffects,GetUpdateMask,UpdateStimpakRadawayEnabled,CanSwitchTabs,CanLowerPipboy,SetIsDirty,AnnounceDataChange,onPerksTabOpen,onPerksTabClose,onNextPerk,onPrevPerk`.
3. Outdoors: F10, wait 10 seconds, take a screenshot, F10 again.
4. Send the `step=load_movie`, `step=code_obj`, `step=code_obj_init` and every `step=code_call` line, any `refuse`
   line, and the screenshot.

What it shows, whatever the result: whether Starfield draws the page's frame from the player's file alone (the
screenshot), whether the page has `InitCodeObj` at its root and takes our object (`found=1 called=1`), and which of
the 16 names it calls, with what. PASS: `result=1`, `step=code_obj ... set=17 of=17 read_back=1`, the page's frame on
screen with empty values, no crash. `found=0`: the page takes its object some other way, and 2b's card starts from
the call lines and D2's `PipboyMenu` names. Values stay empty until 2b.

**Proof 2a, the first run (owner PC, 13 Nov, 05:48 to 05:52 UTC, at `95e79c5a`): the page draws; the hand-over did not
happen. Verified.** Starfield draws the player's STAT page from the file alone: a highlighted `INTELLIGENCE` row with
`( + )`, the six condition bars, two weapon tiles and the placeholder name `ALBERT`, mid-screen at the stage's own size,
with no frame or tabs (those are the shell's). But `step=code_obj ... set=16 of=17 read_back=0` on all five logged
tries: the stand-in was built with its 16 functions, and `root.BGSCodeObj = stand-in` failed. No `code_obj_init`, no
`code_call`, no `refuse`, no crash. The reading (the PC's, and mine): the page's root is its own sealed class, which
takes no new member, where the boot sequence's timeline root did; and since the set never counted as done,
`InitCodeObj` was never called. The page shows its design-time placeholders, so 2b can be judged by a placeholder
(`ALBERT`, a bar) being replaced.

**Proof 2a, the second run: the card.** Plugin code, so the PC rebuilds. The stand-in is now handed over by
`CodeObjInit=` whether or not `root.BGSCodeObj` takes it: once the stand-in is built with all its functions, the
plugin calls `root.<name>(stand-in)`, then reads `root.codeObj` back, and logs
`step=code_obj_init when= try= name= got= found= type= called= result_type= code_obj= code_obj_type=`. A call that
went through ends the tries for this movie; for a movie whose root takes `BGSCodeObj` (the boot sequence) nothing
changes. Same steps and settings as the first run.
PASS: `step=code_obj_init ... found=1 called=1 ... code_obj=1 code_obj_type=8` (the page kept our object as its
`codeObj`), then `code_call` lines for whatever the page calls on it, with the page drawn as before and no crash.
`found=0`: `InitCodeObj` is not a public member of the page's root, and the hand-over is the shell's
(`PipboyMenu.swf`); 2b then starts from D2's `PipboyMenu` names. `called=1 code_obj=0`: the page took the call but
keeps the object elsewhere; the `code_call` lines show whether it uses it.

**Proof 2a, the second run (owner PC, 13 Nov, 06:07 to 06:11 UTC, at `9858bc26`): PASS, verified.** `step=code_obj_init
when=load try=1 name=InitCodeObj got=1 found=1 type=11 called=1 result_type=0 code_obj=1 code_obj_type=8`: the page
has a public `InitCodeObj` and kept our object as its `codeObj`, which confirms the D2 reading. `set=16 of=17
read_back=0` as expected for the sealed root. No `code_call` in 14 seconds with the page left alone, no `refuse`, no
crash; the page shows its design-time contents. So the page's values do not come through any call it makes: the data
arrives another way, which 2b has to find.

**Proof 2b, step i, the card: what the page exposes (read-only).** Plugin code, so the PC rebuilds. D2's STAT page names
a data path (`PipboyChangeEvent`, `PIPBOY_CHANGE_EVENT`, `onPipboyChangeEvent`, `onPipboyChangeEventInternal`,
`DataObj`, `_DataObj`, `UpdateMask`, `Pipboy_DataObj`, `InvalidateData`, `onAnnounceDataChange`) and the values by name
(`CurrHP`, `MaxHP`). The reading (not verified): Fallout 4's shell hands each page a `PipboyChangeEvent` carrying the
data object and an update mask, and the page's `onPipboyChangeEvent` copies the values it needs. Before anything is
pushed, this step reads which of those names are public on the page's root and of what type.
`CodeObjProbe=<path>,...` (with `CodeObj=1` only; it ships empty): once per movie, right after the hand-over, each path
(a root member, or members joined by `.`) is read with `GetMember` and logged as `step=code_obj_probe n= name= found=
type= value=` (the value only for a boolean or a number). Nothing is set or called.
1. Install and settings as for proof 2a's second run, plus
   `CodeObjProbe=onPipboyChangeEvent,onPipboyChangeEventInternal,ProcessUserEvent,InvalidateData,onAnnounceDataChange,DataObj,_DataObj,UpdateMask,codeObj,bAcquiredByNativeCode,onAcquiredByNativeCode,ReleaseCodeObj,CurrHP,MaxHP,PlayerInfo,stage`.
2. Outdoors: F10, wait 5 seconds, F10 again.
3. Send every `step=code_obj_probe` line and the `step=code_obj_init` line.

PASS: sixteen `code_obj_probe` lines, no crash. Types: 11 is a function, 8 an object, 10 a display object, 0 missing or
undefined. What it decides: if `onPipboyChangeEvent` (or `onPipboyChangeEventInternal`) is a public function, step ii
calls it with an event the plugin builds; if only `DataObj` or `_DataObj` is public, step ii writes `CurrHP` and `MaxHP`
into it and calls `InvalidateData`; if neither, the hand-over of data belongs to the shell, and step ii loads
`PipboyMenu.swf` around the page.

**Proof 2b step i, the result (owner PC, 13 Nov, 06:25 to 06:29 UTC, at `3dff85fb`): verified.** Sixteen
`code_obj_probe` lines, no crash. Public on the page's root: `ProcessUserEvent` (11, a function), `codeObj` (8, our
object), `bAcquiredByNativeCode` (2, a boolean, value 0), `onAcquiredByNativeCode` (11), `ReleaseCodeObj` (11) and
`stage` (10). Not found (`found=0 type=-1`; -1 means nothing was read): `onPipboyChangeEvent`,
`onPipboyChangeEventInternal`, `InvalidateData`, `onAnnounceDataChange`, `DataObj`, `_DataObj`, `UpdateMask`,
`CurrHP`, `MaxHP` and `PlayerInfo`. So by the decision table there is no data entry point on the root. Two leads from
the PC before loading the whole shell: `bAcquiredByNativeCode` is false while `onAcquiredByNativeCode` is public, an
acquire step Fallout 4's engine makes and nobody has made here; and the change event may be dispatched on `stage`
rather than called as a method.

**Proof 2b step ii, the card: the acquire step, then the same probe.** Plugin code, so the PC rebuilds.
`CodeObjCalls=<path>,...` (with `CodeObj=1` only; it ships empty): once per movie, on the try that finished the
hand-over and before the probe, each path is called with no arguments and logged as `step=code_obj_root_call n= name=
found= type= called= result_type=`. A path that is not a function is not called.
1. Install and settings as for step i (the same `CodeObjProbe=` line), plus `CodeObjCalls=onAcquiredByNativeCode`.
2. Outdoors: F10, wait 10 seconds, take a screenshot, F10 again.
3. Send the `step=code_obj_init`, `step=code_obj_root_call`, every `step=code_obj_probe` and every `step=code_call`
   line, and the screenshot.

PASS: `code_obj_root_call ... name=onAcquiredByNativeCode found=1 type=11 called=1`, then `bAcquiredByNativeCode`
probed as 1, no crash. What it decides: if new data names appear on the root, or calls come in on our object
(`code_call`), step iii uses them; if nothing changes, step iii takes the second lead and dispatches the change event
on `stage`, which needs an event the plugin builds, or loads `PipboyMenu.swf` around the page.

**Proof 2b step ii, the result (owner PC, 13 Nov, 07:05 to 07:09 UTC, at `e3a754b4`): verified.**
`code_obj_root_call n=1 name=onAcquiredByNativeCode found=1 type=11 called=1 result_type=0`, and
`bAcquiredByNativeCode` then probes `value=1` (it was 0). The other fifteen probe lines are unchanged; no `code_call`,
no `refuse`, no crash. So acquiring the page opens nothing on its root. With the owner's direction (13 Nov, "do what
you think is best off of seeing how it works in fallout 4"), the next step is Fallout 4's own way of feeding a page:
the shell `PipboyMenu.swf` around it. That is S1 below (`pipboy-device-plan` rev 11, the screen side).

**S1, the shell with its pages: what Fallout 4 has (the engine read, FAL-680; names only).** Fallout 4 draws the
Pip-Boy menu at 876 x 700 (D1's stage), and feeds it from 11 data classes, one per top-level branch: `Stats`,
`Special`, `Perks`, `Inventory`, `Quests`, `Workshop`, `Log`, `Map`, `Radio`, `PlayerInfo`, `Status`. S1 does not feed
any of them: it shows the frame. S3, the data feed, builds those branches later, STAT's first.

**S1, the card: the shell with its pages (owner PC; scripts only, the dll of `e3a754b4` unchanged, FAL-614).** The
installer's new `--page-movie <page>` (with `--extra-movie` only) packs the player's own tab movies into the private
probe archive under the very names the shell loads them by: `Pipboy_StatsPage`, `Pipboy_InvPage`, `Pipboy_DataPage`,
`Pipboy_MapPage`, `Pipboy_RadioPage` (each named once, each checked as a whole SWF; nothing else). The plugin is not
changed: `Movie=` already loads any `FO4SF_` movie, and the stand-in, `CodeObjProbe=` and their logs are the ones of
`e3a754b4`. No kit screen, no device path: this is the flat menu (F10), the power-armor mode's floor.
0. **Read first (PC, private, names only; no launch).**
   - From D2's private output for `PipboyMenu.swf`: the page file names the shell names beside `PipboyLoader`. If they
     are the five bare names above, go on. If they carry a folder or another name: **STOP**, report the names only,
     and the next commit adds them. NEEDS-SOLE.
   - The names-only listing of `Starfield - Interface.ba2` (the look survey's tool): none of the five names, and no
     `PipboyMenu.swf`, may be there (Starfield has no Pip-Boy movie, **hypothesis**). A hit is a **STOP**: report it.
1. **Stage** (a clean worktree at this card's head): `make_pipboy_probe.py stage <exp>`. Copy, unchanged, from the
   player's `Fallout4 - Interface.ba2` into `<exp>\Data\Interface\`: `PipboyMenu.swf` as `FO4SF_Fo4Shell.swf`, and the
   five pages under their own names (`Pipboy_StatsPage.swf` ...). `make_pipboy_probe.py check`. Then, between
   `plugin_toggle.py on` and `off`: `pipboy_probe_install.py install --dir <exp> --extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Shell
   --page-movie Pipboy_StatsPage --page-movie Pipboy_InvPage --page-movie Pipboy_DataPage --page-movie Pipboy_MapPage
   --page-movie Pipboy_RadioPage --starfield <game>`. A refusal is a **STOP**: report its line.
2. **The plugin:** the dll built from `e3a754b4` (the one proof 2b step ii ran), its ini, `versionlib-1-16-244-0.bin`.
   In the ini: `Stage=2`, `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Shell`, `CodeObj=1`, `CodeObjHide=0`, `CodeObjSound=0`, `CodeObjInit=` empty,
   `CodeObjCalls=` empty, `CodeObjNames=` proof 2a's line (the PC may put the shell's own verbs from D2 in its place,
   16 at most, and records the line it used), and
   `CodeObjProbe=BGSCodeObj,codeObj,InitCodeObj,bAcquiredByNativeCode,onAcquiredByNativeCode,ProcessUserEvent,ReleaseCodeObj,onPipboyChangeEvent,onPipboyChangeEventInternal,InvalidateData,DataObj,_DataObj,UpdateMask,Pipboy_DataObj,PipboyLoader,stage`.
3. **Run:** outdoors, F10, wait 15 seconds, one screenshot at 5 s and one at 15 s, F10 again. Once more if the first
   shows nothing (a second open loads the movie afresh). Then uninstall and restore as for proof 2b.
4. **Send:** the `step=load_movie`, `step=code_obj`, every `step=code_obj_probe` and `step=code_call` line, any
   `refuse` line, the two screenshots (described: frame, tab bar, which page shows, placeholders, font, size and
   place on screen), and whether the game stayed playable.

**PASS S1:** `load_movie ... result=1 movie_name=FO4SF_Fo4Shell`; on screen the shell's frame and its tab bar (STAT,
INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO), with the STAT page inside it showing its design-time placeholders (2a's `ALBERT`, the bars);
no crash. A picture at the stage's own size, not filling the screen, still passes; the size is S1's later work. What
each other outcome means:
- `code_obj ... read_back=1`: the shell's root takes `BGSCodeObj` as the boot sequence's did, and the probe lines show
  which of its names are public. `read_back=0` with `set=` one short: the root is sealed like the page's; the next card
  hands the stand-in over through a name the probe or D2 shows.
- The frame and tabs show but no page: the shell did not load the page. Either it waits for a call or data (the
  `code_call` lines and the probe say which), or the name in step 0 was wrong.
- `code_call` lines: the shell's verbs on our object, with their arguments. They are the list for S4 (input) and S3.
- Nothing shows, or it freezes: the shell waits for the engine. The probe lines say what it has; send the log.
- A crash: send the crash log privately; `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Boot` is proof 1 as it passed.
- The font: if the text is not Fallout 4's typeface, that is S2 (`fonts_en.swf` is also Starfield's name).

**S1, the result (owner PC, 14 Nov, 07:58 to 08:02 UTC, at `92244e49` with the dll of `e3a754b4`): PARTIAL, verified.
The card's "frame and tabs show but no page".** Step 0 passed: the shell names the five pages bare, and none is in
`Starfield - Interface.ba2`. The installer took the shell and the five pages without a refusal.
- The log, the same on both opens: `load_movie ... result=1 movie_name=FO4SF_Fo4Shell`, then `code_obj when=load try=1
  ... set=17 of=17 read_back=1`. Unlike the STAT page's sealed root, the shell's root takes `BGSCodeObj`. The probe
  finds only `BGSCodeObj` (8) and `stage` (10); the other 14 are `found=0`, `PipboyLoader` among them. There is no
  `code_call` in 15 seconds and no `refuse`.
- On screen: the tab bar (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO, with STAT selected and the LT and RT hints), and a sub-tab row
  reading STATUS five times. The footer shows its placeholders (`HP 80/80`, LEVEL with a full bar, `AP 90/90`). All
  of it is white and grey, stretched across the screen over the live world, and nothing animates. There is no page
  body, no bezel and no green tint, and the typeface does not look like Fallout 4's (S2). F10 closes the menu, and the
  game stays playable; no crash, no save.
- The plugin logs nothing for the page loads or for the missing `PipboyMobileSettings.swf`, so this log cannot say
  whether the shell asked for them.

**What the result settles (a reading).**
- The missing bezel and tint are expected. Fallout 4's bezel is the device model, and its engine tints the movies (S5).
  The stretch is the menu's scale mode, which is later S1 work.
- The shell is waiting, not failing. Its design-time placeholders are untouched (STATUS five times), so none of its
  code that fills them from data has run.
- The probe cannot see where the shell's logic sits. It reads members of the root once, at the hand-over (`when=load`,
  try 1), and the shell's code is not under those 14 names there. Either it sits in a placed child clip or another
  class, or it uses names we did not list.
- D2's `onCodeObjCreate` and `onCodeObjDestruction` were neither probed nor called. **Hypothesis**: as in Fallout 4's
  other menus, the engine sets `BGSCodeObj` and then calls `onCodeObjCreate`, and nothing calls it here.
- The engine read (PB-RE-1 part A, A6) says Fallout 4 feeds the menu from 11 `Pipboy*Data` classes. **Hypothesis**:
  the shell shows a page only once its data or a tab arrives.

**S1's next slice: the decision (14 Nov, FAL-786). Read first, then an ini-only card on the same dll.**
1. **S1-R1, a names-only read** of the player's `PipboyMenu.swf` with `scripts/ui/swf_names.py`, with no launch. It
   says which class each name sits in, which instances are placed by name, and which names each method uses. The next
   card's probe and calls then use paths that exist, not guesses.
2. **S1-b, ini only, with the dll of `e3a754b4`:** probe the paths R1 shows, and list the shell's own engine verbs in
   `CodeObjNames=` so `code_call` shows what it asks for. Then make the shell's arrival call (`onCodeObjCreate`, or
   what R1 shows) with `CodeObjCalls=`.

Not chosen now:
- **Logging the shell's page loads in the plugin:** that is plugin code and a PC rebuild for a yes or no. S1-b reads it
  from the loader's own members if R1 finds them. It becomes the next card only if S1-b cannot tell whether a page was
  asked for.
- **Supplying data:** R1 says which call or event is needed, and what shape it has. A call that needs an argument, or
  an event the plugin builds, is plugin code, so it waits for R1. S3 starts there.

**S1-R1, the card (Claude PC; read-only, no launch; names only, the output stays private).** Environment: PowerShell,
this branch at the commit that adds `swf_names.py` (a clean checkout, or `git archive` into a scratch folder), Python
as for D1. Nothing is written under the game folders.
1. `python scripts/ui/swf_names.py --ba2 "<Fallout 4>\Data\Fallout4 - Interface.ba2" PipboyMenu.swf
   Pipboy_StatsPage.swf`, with its output redirected into the PC's private evidence folder.
   - It reads both movies in memory and prints names only: the classes and their members, the instances placed by
     name, and, for each method, the names it calls and reads and the identifier strings it pushes.
   - A string that is not an identifier is counted, never printed. No code and no bytes are printed.
2. Send back names and counts only:
   - **a. The root:** the `symbol id=0` line, that class's `class` line and its `trait of=instance` lines, and the
     `place in=0` lines (the root's named instances, with their classes).
   - **b. The loader:** every `place` or `trait` line whose name holds `Loader`, `Page`, `Tab` or `Swap`. Also the
     `uses` lines of the methods whose `strings=` hold a page's file name (`Pipboy_StatsPage.swf` ...).
   - **c. The engine calls:** the `uses` lines whose `names=` hold `BGSCodeObj` or whose `calls=` hold `call`, and the
     identifier strings in them (the verbs passed to the engine).
   - **d. The arrival and the data:** the `uses` lines of `onCodeObjCreate`, `onCodeObjDestruction`, `InitCodeObj`
     and `onAcquiredByNativeCode`. Also those of any method whose `names=` or `strings=` hold `DataObj`, `ChangeEvent`,
     `UpdateMask` or `PipboyData`. Each line names its class.
   - **e. For `Pipboy_StatsPage.swf`:** only the `uses` lines of the methods that d shows the shell calling on a page.
   - **f. Counts:** the lines of each kind, and every `partial` line (a method body the reader could not finish; its
     names stop there).
3. A `partial` or `not_swf` line is not a STOP: report it.

**What S1-b does with R1 (its card follows R1; ini only, the dll of `e3a754b4` unchanged).**
- `CodeObjNames=`: the shell's verbs from c, 16 at most, so every `code_call` line names what the shell asks for.
- `CodeObjProbe=`: paths from a, b and d through the placed instances (for example `<instance>.<member>`), 16 at
  most. They show where the loader and the data entry sit, and whether they are public.
- `CodeObjCalls=`: the arrival call from d (for example `onCodeObjCreate` or `<instance>.onCodeObjCreate`), once,
  with no arguments, right after the hand-over.
- PASS S1-b: the STAT page's body inside the shell (2a's `ALBERT`, the bars), or `code_call` lines that name what the
  shell waits for.
- Each of these is a plugin card instead:
  - a call that needs an argument;
  - a value returned from our object;
  - an event the plugin builds;
  - a loader that R1 shows is created by a method rather than placed (the probe runs at load only, so it cannot see
    it).

**S1-R1, the result (Claude PC, 14 Nov, read at `0ae13422`, no launch): verified, names only.** Both movies read
whole: no `partial`, no `not_swf`, 3,641 lines in all; the output stays private on the PC.
- **The root:** `PipboyMenu.swf` has no document class. The root timeline places one instance, `Menu_mc`, of the
  sealed class `PipboyMenu` (extends `Shared.IMenu`), so every path starts at `Menu_mc`.
  - Public on it: `BGSCodeObj` (an `Object`), `DataObj` (a `Pipboy_DataObj`), `Header_mc`, `BottomBar_mc`,
    `ButtonHintBar_mc` and the getter `CurrentPage`.
  - Public methods include `onCodeObjCreate`, `InvalidateData`, `InvalidatePartialData`, `TryToSetPage`,
    `TryToSetTab` and `ProcessUserEvent`.
  - Private: `PageA` (a vector of `PipboyLoader`), `_IsLoadingPage`, `LoadCurrentPage` and `onPageLoadComplete`.
- **The page load:** only `LoadCurrentPage` holds the five file names. It picks one by `DataObj.CurrentPage`, loads it
  through a `PipboyLoader` and ends in `onPageLoadComplete`. That hands `BGSCodeObj` to the page's `InitCodeObj`, adds
  the page to the display and calls `InvalidateData` again.
- **Why S1 showed no page:** only `InvalidatePartialData` calls `LoadCurrentPage`, and only `InvalidateData` calls
  that. Inside the shell, only `onPageLoadComplete` calls `InvalidateData`. So nothing in the shell starts the first
  load; it waits for a call from outside. `onCodeObjCreate` loads nothing: it calls `PopulatePipboyInfoObj` on
  `BGSCodeObj`, passing `DataObj`.
- **The change event:** `InvalidatePartialData` builds a `PipboyChangeEvent` (an update mask, `DataObj`, `TabNames`)
  and dispatches it itself. A page's tab (`PipboyTab.onPipboyChangeEvent`) shows itself only when that event's
  `DataObj.CurrentTab` equals its index.
- **The engine verbs on `BGSCodeObj`:** `PopulatePipboyInfoObj` (from `onCodeObjCreate`), `onNewPage`
  (`TryToSetPage`), `onNewTab` (`TryToSetTab`), `PlaySound`, `ShowPerksMenu`, `onBackButtonHandled`, and, from the STAT
  page, `onPerksTabOpen` and `onPerksTabClose`. The mobile companion app's verbs are left out.
- **`Pipboy_DataObj.<init>`** builds the data object inside the movie (`_CurrHP`, `_MaxHP`, `_Caps`, `_InvItems` and
  the rest), with a public getter and setter for `CurrentPage` and for `CurrentTab`. So `DataObj` exists before
  anything fills it.
- **Not answered by names:**
  - whether `InvalidateData` takes an argument;
  - what `InvalidatePartialData` compares before it loads;
  - whether a probe by name can see a private member.

**S1-b, the slice: what the shell needs from outside to draw the STAT page body (a reading of R1, FAL-803).**

| The shell needs | Fallout 4's engine (a reading) | S1-b supplies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DataObj` with `CurrentPage` and `CurrentTab` | fills the movie's own object | nothing: the movie's own defaults. That STAT is page 0 and its STATUS tab is tab 0 is a **hypothesis**; the probe logs both values |
| An answer to `PopulatePipboyInfoObj` | fills `DataObj` with the player's values | nothing. Our stand-in sits on the root, so `Menu_mc.BGSCodeObj` stays null and the shell's call goes nowhere. In proof 1 the boot sequence's calls with no object did not fail |
| The `InvalidateData` call | once its object is in place, and again when data changes (a reading) | `Menu_mc.InvalidateData`, once, with no arguments, right after the hand-over (`CodeObjCalls=`), after `Menu_mc.onCodeObjCreate` |
| The change event | none: the shell builds it | nothing. `InvalidatePartialData` dispatches it, and `onPageLoadComplete` calls `InvalidateData` once more after the page is added, so the page's tabs receive it |

- **So the smallest step is two calls, with no plugin code.** The page shows the movie's defaults: zeros, empty text
  or design-time placeholders, not the player's values.
- **No further names read is needed first.** What is still open is not a name, and S1-b's own lines answer it: the
  call's `called=` and the probe's values.
- **Later, each a plugin card:**
  - S1-c: the stand-in on `Menu_mc.BGSCodeObj`, a set on a path, so the shell's verbs arrive as `code_call`;
  - S3: real values in `DataObj`.

**S1-b, the card (Claude PC; one session after the owner's launch release; the dll of `e3a754b4`, ini only).** This
is the card posted on FAL-762 on 14 Nov, unchanged.
1. **Stage and install** exactly as the S1 session: a worktree at `92244e49` or `0ae13422` (the scripts are the same),
   the six movies as before, and `--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Shell` with the five `--page-movie` options.
2. **The ini** as in the S1 session, with three keys changed:
   - `CodeObjNames=PopulatePipboyInfoObj,onNewPage,onNewTab,PlaySound,ShowPerksMenu,onBackButtonHandled,onPerksTabOpen,onPerksTabClose`
   - `CodeObjCalls=Menu_mc.onCodeObjCreate,Menu_mc.InvalidateData`
   - `CodeObjProbe=Menu_mc,BGSCodeObj,Menu_mc.BGSCodeObj,Menu_mc.DataObj,Menu_mc.DataObj.CurrentPage,Menu_mc.DataObj.CurrentTab,Menu_mc.DataObj.TabNames,Menu_mc.CurrentPage,Menu_mc.Header_mc,Menu_mc.BottomBar_mc,Menu_mc.ButtonHintBar_mc,Menu_mc.onCodeObjCreate,Menu_mc.InvalidateData,Menu_mc.InvalidatePartialData,Menu_mc.TryToSetPage,Menu_mc.PageA`
3. **Run** as S1: outdoors, F10, a screenshot at about 5 s and one at 15 s, F10 again; then the same once more.
4. **Send:** the `step=code_obj` line, both `step=code_obj_root_call` lines, the 16 `step=code_obj_probe` lines, any
   `step=code_call` or `refuse` line, the screenshots (described), and whether the game stayed playable.

**PASS S1-b:**
- `code_obj_root_call n=2 name=Menu_mc.InvalidateData found=1 type=11 called=1`;
- on screen, the STAT page's body inside the tab bar and footer: the condition figure or bars, with zeros, empty text
  or placeholders (2a's `ALBERT` may give way to an empty name);
- no crash.

No `code_call` lines are expected: the shell and its page see a null `BGSCodeObj` (see the table).

What each other outcome means:
- `n=1` with `called=0`: `onCodeObjCreate` threw on the null object. Not a FAIL if `n=2` went through.
- `n=2` with `found=1 called=0`: `InvalidateData` needs an argument, or it threw. The next card is plugin code: a call
  with an argument (`InvalidatePartialData` with an update mask the plugin builds).
- `Menu_mc found=0`: the root had no child yet at the load try, or the probe cannot reach it by name. Then both calls
  were `found=0` and nothing ran. The next card is plugin code: the calls on a later try, or through `getChildByName`.
- Called, but no page after 15 s:
  - if the probe shows `Menu_mc.CurrentPage` equal to `Menu_mc.DataObj.CurrentPage`, the shell may have taken the page
    as already current. The next card sets `DataObj.CurrentPage` (a set on a path, plugin code).
  - Otherwise the load ran and failed, or the page was added and no tab matched `CurrentTab`. The next card logs the
    shell's page loads (plugin code; "not chosen now" above).
- A crash: send the crash log privately. With `CodeObjCalls=` empty, S1 is back as it passed.

**S1-b, installed (14 Nov, about 17:10 UTC, owner PC, FAL-819).** At the owner's request the PC installed S1-b in their
game as their own Pip-Boy, on F10: the dll of `e3a754b4`, the shell and its five pages from their own archive, and the
three ini lines above. The rollback is kept. The owner's verdict and the log are not in yet. The owner's question: can
they go through the pages, or is the screen static? By R1, it is static: changing a page or a tab asks the engine
object, and in S1-b there is none where the shell looks. That is S1-c.

**S1-c, the slice: our object where the shell looks for it, and an answer to a page or tab change (plugin code,
FAL-819).**

How the shell changes a page, by R1's names (a reading; R1 did not list the `uses` lines of the `goto` methods):
- A page change starts in the public `gotoNextPage` or `gotoPrevPage`, or in the header's private `onPageClicked`.
  Each ends in `TryToSetPage`, which calls `onNewPage` on `BGSCodeObj` through `BGSExternalInterface`.
- Tabs work the same way: `gotoNextTab`, `gotoPrevTab` or `onTabClicked`, then `TryToSetTab`, which calls `onNewTab`.
- The engine's answer (**hypothesis**): it records the page or tab in the shell's `DataObj` and calls `InvalidateData`.
  That loads the page (`LoadCurrentPage`) or sends the change event that shows a tab (`PipboyTab` shows itself when
  `DataObj.CurrentTab` is its index).

| The shell needs | S1-c supplies (three ini keys; all off by default) |
| --- | --- |
| an engine object at `Menu_mc.BGSCodeObj` | `CodeObjAt=Menu_mc`: the stand-in is set there as well as on the root, and read back. The hand-over waits until it reads back, so `Menu_mc.onCodeObjCreate` from `CodeObjCalls=` now reaches us with `PopulatePipboyInfoObj`, and every page gets our object through `InitCodeObj` |
| an answer to `onNewPage` and `onNewTab` | `CodeObjPages=1`: the index the shell passes is noted and, at the menu's next update, `Menu_mc.DataObj.CurrentPage` (or `.CurrentTab`) is set to it and read back, then `Menu_mc.InvalidateData()` is called once (`step=code_answer`) |
| the player's input | `ShellKeys=`: keys the plugin reads itself, each calling one of the shell's `goto` methods (the table below) |
| nothing else | `PopulatePipboyInfoObj`, `PlaySound`, `ShowPerksMenu`, `onBackButtonHandled`, `onPerksTabOpen` and `onPerksTabClose` only log. `DataObj` keeps the movie's own defaults: the player's values are S3 |

Every call on our object is now logged with up to four arguments: `step=code_call n= name= args= arg0= arg1= ...`. A
string is logged as text, a number or boolean after `#` (`#2`), and an object by its type. The log keeps the first 256
calls (it was 64).

**The input the shell needs, and how our menu passes it in S1-c.**

| Input | What the shell has for it (R1's names) | S1-c |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keyboard | `ProcessUserEvent` (public) takes the engine's input events by name. R1 did not report which event names it compares | Not through `ProcessUserEvent`. Our menu binds no menu object (its `GetRootPath` answers empty), so Starfield's engine sends the movie no events. The plugin reads the keys itself (`ShellKeys=`) and calls the shell's own public `gotoPrevPage`, `gotoNextPage`, `gotoPrevTab` and `gotoNextTab`, with no arguments, on the menu's thread |
| Mouse | the header's `onPageClicked` and `onTabClicked` (private, click handlers by their names) | The engine's own mouse delivery to our movie, once the menu opens with the cursor (`Flags=` with `0x8`; FAL-216 saw clicks reach our movie at `0x9`). The answer then comes from `CodeObjPages=1`, as for a key |
| Gamepad LB and RB (and LT and RT, which S1's tab bar showed as hints) | `ProcessUserEvent`, by event name | Not in S1-c. `GetAsyncKeyState` does not read a pad. The route is the menu's input handler (slot `0x08`, `OnButtonEvent`, which stages (d) and (e) already replace): it sees Starfield's own user events, which a later slice (S1-d) maps to the same four calls |
| Right stick | `onRightThumbstickInput` (public) | Not in S1-c |

**S1-c, the card (Claude PC; after S1-b's result, and after the owner's release; the dll built at this commit).**
Install it the same way as S1-b, in the owner's game as their own Pip-Boy on F10, with a rollback.
0. **Read first (PC, names only, no launch, optional).** Run `swf_names.py` as in R1 on the other four pages:
   `Pipboy_InvPage.swf Pipboy_DataPage.swf Pipboy_MapPage.swf Pipboy_RadioPage.swf`. Report the verb strings of the
   `uses` lines whose `names=` hold `codeObj` or `BGSCodeObj` and whose `calls=` hold `call`, by page. Up to 8 of
   them, those used when a page arrives or changes tab, go after the 8 names in step 3 (16 at most). Names
   only. Without this read the pages still load, but a page whose verb is missing may stop partway; that is a finding,
   not a STOP.
1. **Build** the plugin from this commit with `build.ps1`, as for `e3a754b4`. A build error is a **STOP**: send it.
   Keep S1-b's dll and ini aside as the rollback.
2. **Install** exactly as S1-b: the same six movies, `--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Shell` and the five `--page-movie`
   options. Then the new dll and its ini.
3. **The ini:** S1-b's, with these changed or added:
   - `CodeObjNames=PopulatePipboyInfoObj,onNewPage,onNewTab,PlaySound,ShowPerksMenu,onBackButtonHandled,onPerksTabOpen,onPerksTabClose`, plus step 0's verbs if read
   - `CodeObjCalls=Menu_mc.onCodeObjCreate,Menu_mc.InvalidateData` (as S1-b)
   - `CodeObjAt=Menu_mc`
   - `CodeObjPages=1`
   - `ShellKeys=0x51:Menu_mc.gotoPrevPage,0x45:Menu_mc.gotoNextPage,0x21:Menu_mc.gotoPrevPage,0x22:Menu_mc.gotoNextPage,0x41:Menu_mc.gotoPrevTab,0x44:Menu_mc.gotoNextTab,0x25:Menu_mc.gotoPrevTab,0x27:Menu_mc.gotoNextTab`
     (Q and E or Page Up and Page Down for the page, A and D or the arrows for the tab, as on the kit's page; Page Up
     and Page Down because the kit's Q did nothing through the PC's key sender, FAL-614)
   - `Flags=0x19`: the cursor and the input contexts the kit's page opens with (`PageFlagSets=0x19`; `Pause=0` adds
     nothing at stage (b)). Whether the game still acts on Q, E, A and D behind the screen is the run's finding.
   - `CodeObjProbe=` as S1-b.
4. **Run:** outdoors, F10, wait 5 s. Press E four times, a second apart (STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO), then Q four
   times back. On STAT, press D twice and A twice. Then click INV and then STAT in the tab bar. Take a screenshot of
   each page. Close with F10; Esc may not close the menu at stage (b).
5. **Send:** the `step=code_obj_shell` and `step=code_obj` lines, both `code_obj_root_call` lines, the probe lines,
   every `code_call`, `shell_key` and `code_answer` line, any `refuse` line, the screenshots described (which page, which
   tab, placeholders), whether the game moved the player or did anything else on those keys, and whether it stayed
   playable. Once the owner has played it, their verdict.

**PASS S1-c:**
- `step=code_obj ... at=Menu_mc at_set=1 at_read_back=1`, and `code_call ... name=PopulatePipboyInfoObj args=1
  arg0=type<n>` (the shell's arrival now reaches our object);
- on E: `shell_key ... path=Menu_mc.gotoNextPage found=1 called=1`, `code_call ... name=onNewPage args=1 arg0=#1`,
  `code_answer ... page=1 ... page_set=1 page_now=#1 ... invalidated=1`, and INV's body in place of STAT's. The same
  through all five pages and back, and for the tabs with `onNewTab` and `tab=`;
- a click on the tab bar does the same, with no `shell_key` line;
- no crash.

What each other outcome means:
- `at_read_back=0` on every try, and no `code_obj_root_call` lines: `Menu_mc.BGSCodeObj` did not take our object. Send
  the 40 tries' lines. The next card reads the slot's type.
- `shell_key ... found=0`: the `goto` names are not reachable by that path. Send the line; the PC reads the four
  methods' `trait` lines.
- `shell_key ... called=1`, but no `onNewPage`: the shell refused the change, or it takes another route. Send the
  probe's `CurrentPage` and the `code_call` lines. If it is the route, the next card calls `TryToSetPage` with an index
  (plugin code: a call with an argument).
- `onNewPage` with `code_answer ... page_set=1 invalidated=1`, but the page stays: `InvalidatePartialData` did not
  reload. The next card calls it with an update mask (plugin code; see S1-b's outcomes).
- `invalidate_found=1 invalidated=0`: `InvalidateData` needs an argument, as in S1-b's case.
- `result=bad_index`: the shell passed something other than an index. The `code_call` line shows what.
- The page changes but its body is empty or half drawn: a verb the page calls is not among `CodeObjNames`. That error
  stays inside the movie, so step 0's read names it.
- The game also acts on the keys (the player moves): send which. The next card picks other keys or flags.
- A crash: send the crash log privately and restore S1-b (its dll and ini), which is how the owner played it.

Every page shows the movie's own defaults, not the player's values; that is S3. The device route stays separate: the
wrist model is #780 (card A''), which still waits for the owner's release. No kit screen on the device path.

**Proof 2, the outline (route A): the STAT page.** Each step has its own card once the one before it has run.
- **2a, the page alone:** `Movie=FO4SF_Fo4Stats`, the player's `Pipboy_StatsPage.swf` installed with
  `--extra-movie FO4SF_Fo4Stats`, and `CodeObj=1` with the page's own names in `CodeObjNames`. Shows: the page's frame
  with no data, and which of its calls arrive. The names to list come from D2 and proof 1b; which of them are calls is
  a guess until the log shows it.
- **2b, HP by name:** our plugin pushes `CurrHP` and `MaxHP` into the page by the path 2a's log shows. Not written
  until 2a has run.

## Look and function: the seam

- **Function** (one, shared by every look): the pages, what each row or widget is fed, and input. It is the
  **union** of what every game's Pip-Boy needs (owner, 13 Nov), not Fallout 4's list alone; the next section lists it.
  - The values the plugin promises every look today: the value providers (`make_pipboy_kit.py` `VALUE_PROVIDERS`:
    health, level, xp, carry_max, rads, cell, world, time, days, position, heading, grid, `av:<id>`).
  - The lists: inventory and quests, and later markers.
  - The events: tab and sub-tab moves, selection, click, open and close.
  - Added by later function work: the map's world values (section c).
- **A look** is files plus settings. The files are the screen movies, fonts and images, later the device model,
  animations and sounds, each converted from that game's own files on the player's PC. The settings are:
  - the look's name;
  - which movie is the shell;
  - how each function value reaches it: by our field names (route B), or by the original's data names (route A).
  The converter writes a look into its own private folder and archive.
- **How a look is chosen:** one ini setting names the look. The plugin loads that look's shell and falls back to our
  kit movie, which is always present and is the debug view. Fallout 4 is the first look; Fallout 3, New Vegas and 76
  are not surveyed or converted now.
- **Per game, not one world (the seam for Fallout 76 and later).** Nothing in the plugin or the menu may assume one
  world map or one fixed set of pages:
  - The page set is data. It already is: the kit's `[Page]` sections.
  - A world map belongs to the world the player is in. It is chosen by WORLD, never fixed in code. The Commonwealth's
    map comes with the Fallout 4 conversion; another game's world brings its own.
  - Fallout 76's map style and extra features are function, decided by the owner later.

## The function union: a first inventory by game

Owner, 13 Nov: "the main functioning should just be a combination of everything that's needed from each of the
games." So the function side is one Pip-Boy holding every feature that Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4 and 76 need (more
games later). The looks stay per game.

**Source of this table.** Written from memory of the games, without reading their files. **None of it is verified.**
`known` means what players of that game see; `unread` means it is not certain whether, or where, that game has it.
No other game's files are surveyed now.

Games: **3** = Fallout 3, **NV** = New Vegas, **4** = Fallout 4, **76** = Fallout 76.

| Function id | What it shows or does | 3 | NV | 4 | 76 | Ours today |

| `map.world` | the world map with the player's arrow and markers | known | known | known | known (its own style) | rows: world, position, heading, grid |
| `map.local` | the local map around the player | known | known | known | unread | - |
| `map.travel` | fast travel from the map | known | known | known | known (with a cost) | **not designed (owner's later decision)** |
| `radio.stations` | stations found, tune and turn off | known (under DATA) | known (under DATA) | known | known | notice only |

**The function contract every look is fed from.**
- Every function has a stable id (the table's first column). It has a home tab that is the same for every look:
  STAT, INV, DATA, MAP, RADIO. In Fallout 3 and New Vegas the map and radio sit under DATA, so a look also says
  where its own tabs put each id.
- For each id, the function side promises the same feed to every look: its values (value providers), its lists
  (list providers), and its events (move, select, click, open, close). These are today's kit pieces, extended by id.
- A look declares which ids it has a page of its own for. For example, a Fallout 4 look has no `stat.skills` page,
  and a Fallout 3 look has no `data.workshops` page.
- **A function the look's game lacks gets a generic page in that look's style:** the look's frame, font and list and
  value widgets, filled from the same feed. The kit's text rows are the ultimate fallback, so no feature is ever left
  without a place.
- A **stated gap** is used only when a function cannot be drawn in a look at all, for example a world map in a look
  that has no map component and no image to show. The gap is logged once with the look and the id, and the page says
  so in words.
- Which functions exist at all is the owner's choice per function, as with travel and Fallout 76's additions. This
  table is the shape, not a promise to build every row.

**The first build stays Fallout 4.** Fallout 4's look and Fallout 4's functions come first: the rows that are
`known` under 4. The union is the shape the code keeps room for (ids, the home tab, generic pages), not the first
delivery.

## What this plan does not do

- No code, no conversion, no movie of the player's in Git or anywhere public. Every converted byte stays on the PC.
- No travel from the map, no `coc` from the plugin, no fast travel.
- No survey or conversion of Fallout 3, New Vegas or 76 now.
- No change to the pause default or to the stages. The kit's text rows stay.

## Next gate

1. Done: D1 and D3 (13 Nov).
2. Done: D2 and proof 1 (13 Nov): route A is alive.
3. Done: proof 1b (13 Nov, third run) and proof 1c (13 Nov, `CodeObjHide=1`).
4. Done: read D4 and proof 1d (13 Nov, the sounds by route S2, PASS by the log; the owner's ear still to hear it).
5. Done: proof 2a, the STAT page alone (13 Nov, second run: the page draws and takes our object through
   `InitCodeObj`). Done: proof 2b step i (no data entry on the root) and step ii (the acquire step opens nothing).
6. Done: S1, the shell with its pages (14 Nov, PARTIAL: the tab bar and footer draw; no page).
7. Done: S1-R1 (14 Nov, names only, no launch): the shell loads its first page only when `Menu_mc.InvalidateData` is
   called from outside.
8. Now: S1-b (ini only, the dll of `e3a754b4`; its card above). Installed in the owner's game on 14 Nov; their
   verdict and the log are not in yet.
9. Next: S1-c (plugin code at this commit: `CodeObjAt=`, `CodeObjPages=`, `ShellKeys=`; its card above). It needs a
   review, a CARRY, then the PC's build and run after S1-b's result and the owner's release. Then S1-d (the gamepad
   through the menu's input handler) and S3's first branch (STAT, HP by name) through the shell, each with its own
   card.
