# Next-phase framework: the questions we have to answer, and the possibilities for each

Started 2026-10-19 by Claude-cloud (framework thread) on the owner's ask: "build a framework of questions and things
for what we are going to do; look at modding communities, the tools, and other things." A living document, extended in
waves. **Wave 1 done 2026-10-19 ~18:05Z; wave 2 (gap filling) folded in ~18:30Z**: 11 research agents (raw findings with every source in
[findings/](findings/)), folded into 7 cross-cutting files with about 280 numbered questions, plus the five phase files
the phase threads write. Nothing here is decided until the owner says so; every "recommend" is a default to argue with.

## How to use it

- Each question has a stable ID (`WP-14`, `REL-26` ...), why it matters, the options with sources, how to answer it
  (owner decision, offline research, PC probe, community or Bethesda/Nexus contact), what it blocks, and a status.
- Evidence labels follow docs/ai/research-log.md: **verified** (read in a linked source or file), **supported
  hypothesis**, **unresolved**. Wave 1 ran out of web-search budget and hit Nexus rate limits part way, so every file has
  a "Gaps for wave 2" list; nothing was guessed to fill them.
- To answer a question: write the answer and its evidence under the question (status `answered: ...` or `decided by
  owner, <date>`), and record architectural decisions in docs/ai/decisions.md.

## Settled already (do not re-ask)

Silent player by default. Starfield's animations first, FO4 clips later. SFSE and the free Starfield Creation Kit MAY
be required. The Commonwealth, Far Harbor and Nuka-World share one Earth-like planet with real days, nights and weather.
Phase order: new game (Vault 111 start, no Starfield intro), door animations, all interiors, launcher; then world
breadth, people and story, Fallout systems (order open). GitHub release first, then Nexus (GPL-3 notice for Mutagen).
Breadth before polish. A launcher that ships no assets; the player owns both games.

[multi-game-scope](findings/multi-game-scope.md).

## What wave 1 changed in the picture (biggest findings)

1. **Voice audio is the sharpest legal risk.** Capital Wasteland (FO3 in FO4) built a tool to convert the player's own
   FO3 audio and cancelled it in 2018 after Bethesda staff and a lawyer flagged it: voice acting is licensed, not owned
   (**verified**, findings/precedents.md). Our `scripts/actors/codsworth_voice.py` has the same shape. REL-26, REL-27.
2. **We rest on tolerance, not permission.** Read literally, Bethesda's terms forbid tools "created for" its games
   without written permission; the Starfield CK EULA names an approval route for cross-game mods. A player-side
   cross-game converter (FNV to FO4, GPL-3) has been on Nexus since 2023 (**verified**). REL-30, REL-31.
3. **Most players own a different Fallout 4 than we pin, and our archive reader can't open it yet.** Steam is on
   1.11.240 (Aug 2026), we pin 1.10.163. The April 2024 next-gen update added BA2 header versions 7 and 8, which xEdit
   and OpenMW read with the v1 layout (**verified**, wave 2); `src/fo4sf/ba2.py` accepts 1 to 3 only. Small fix:
   accept {1, 7, 8}. VM-01 to VM-03.
4. **Starfield's own Earth is a serious host.** It already has a 24 h day, the real Sun and Moon, and handmade overlays
   at real city coordinates; PNDT `EOVR` may add our overlays without overriding the planet's list (**supported
   hypothesis**). Three landings, not one worldspace. WP-01, WP-08, WP-14.
5. **Lip sync at master scale is proven by the community** (the CK's FaceFX compiler over all of Starfield.esm), but no
   one has shown it unattended or timed it; unvoiced lines flash past unreadably without silent placeholders. PS-08, PS-07.
6. **The dialogue menu is a loose SWF**, so a Fallout-style choice list is a UI file job, likely without SFSE. PS-01.
7. **No public total conversion automates in-game testing like we do**; the ecosystem is ahead on crash signatures
   (sf-crash-logger, GPL-3), Spriggit record diffs, and Starfield's own `Debug` test functions (which work in retail is
   open). TT-23, TT-15, TT-25.
8. **Engine ceilings we will meet at full scale:** 256 active BA2s, 253 full-master slots, archives over 4 GiB may not
   load, no precombines. VM-23 to VM-28.
9. **No Starfield mod has a furniture-style power armor or a real VATS**; Starcade OS shows a Pip-Boy shape (an item
   opens an HTML menu through OSF UI). Passed to the engine-mechanics thread.
10. **Mod managers handle Starfield natively now** (MO2 2.5.2, Vortex); SFSE refuses the Game Pass build. REL and launcher.

## What wave 2 added (gap filling)

- **Licence line (verified):** the GPL FAQ treats programs that talk over pipes or command-line arguments as separate
  programs; a launcher that loads Mutagen in-process becomes GPL-3. SFSE is not permissively licensed (only
  `PluginAPI.h` is MIT) and does not support Game Pass. REL-01, VM-21.
- **Nexus (verified):** auto-update does not count as "crucial" for an internet-using executable; network features need a
  staff review with source; an AI-content tag is now required. Bethesda's own mod rules ban getting around add-on
  purchases, so the converter should check DLC ownership before converting each DLC. REL.
- **CK steps:** LOD has a command line (`CreationKit.exe -MockWorldSpaceLOD:<plugin> <worldspaces>`, **verified**);
  Starfield cells carry no precombine or previs fields (**supported hypothesis**: no bake step). Named NPC faces are
  pre-baked per form ID by two CK bakes. Lip sync stays GUI-only until the queued PC job answers. TT, AP, PS.
- **Limits (verified):** medium masters hold 65,536 new records, with 256 slots. BA2 offsets are 64-bit; whether Starfield
  loads an archive over 4 GiB is still open. VM-23 to VM-28.
- **Saves:** the game itself clears active plugins in Plugins.txt when a save loads or the Creations menu opens (users'
  reports, matching newgame.md L). VM-14.
- **Still unresolved after wave 2:** any DMCA or takedown of a cross-game converter (none found); how Shattered Space's
  landmass was built (a read of its esm settles it); whether Starfield needs an SEQ file for start-game dialogue quests
  (one PC probe; our writer could make one); Wwise terms for batch conversion on players' PCs.

## Cross-cutting points from the phase threads (wave 1)

- **New game:** `StartupQuest_DO` may be a cleaner override than stopping MQ00 and MQ101 (newgame.md NG-A1).
- **Licences:** our built .NET tools are GPL-3 through Mutagen; CALUMI is LGPL (door-animations.md J38, J39). Creations
  is likely closed to us (J40; also REL-13).
- **Mutagen pin:** alpha.75 shipped today, we pin alpha.67 (TT). The "Fallout4 2.8.1-prerelease002" package named in
  next-phase/launcher-gamma-model-and-community-tools.md is an unlisted 2021 package, not a newer release (correction,
  from the Interiors thread).
- **Record tools disagree:** Mutagen and xEdit read the LIGH flag bits from bit 4 up differently (Interiors thread).
- **CK risk:** the Starfield CK may crash on terminals written outside it (Interiors thread; affects TT CK-only steps).
- **Locations:** the port writes no XLCN on interior cells, so our interiors have no location, leveling or cleared state
  today (Interiors thread; touches PS radiant quests and WP map).
- **Interior count (reconciled, interiors.md "Count reconciliation"):** 230 in the repo's interior-backlog.json counts
  interiors behind the Commonwealth worldspace's own load doors (203 plus 27 second-hop); 271 in the census adds 41
  entered from the walled Diamond City and Goodneighbor worldspaces. The plan builds 251 of the 255 still to do (4 have
  no door model), plus 2 from Automatron.
- **Medium-master test:** interiors.md declines the synthetic-plugin probe for itself (FO4Port stays a full master); it
  stays open for VM-25 and the planet master (WP-04).
- **Engine mechanics wave 2:** an own engine menu is partly possible via CommonLibSF; Mutagen types Starfield FACT fully
  but has no RELA group; Address Library supports 1.16.244; the Carbon UI licence needs its author's word; new precedent
  BACUP, a GPL-3 Creation Engine record and asset converter. A read-only PC job (CK command-line switches for lip
  generation, script compiling, animation data) is queued; its answer settles PS-08, AP-40 and TT CK-only steps.
- **Saves (newgame.md L):** the Creations load-order prompt with Save preselected silently switches our plugins off on
  old saves (verified on the owner's PC). Touches VM-14 and REL-51.
- **Map markers (PR #399, map-markers.md on its branch):** FO4 markers carry a 66-icon Type enum; Starfield's Type is a
  bare byte with no enum in Mutagen. Whether Starfield has icons for Vault, Metro and Diamond City is unresolved (a TNAM
  census of Starfield.esm settles it). Touches WP map questions.
- **Voice reuse** is flagged as the owner's decision by engine-mechanics.md too (same decision as REL-26).

## Where the files disagree (to settle first)

- **SFSE for release 1.** tooling-and-testing recommends requiring CK and SFSE for release 1 (TT-39); people-and-story
  (PS-35), versions-and-maintenance (VM-17) and asset-pipeline (AP-45) recommend a data-only core with SFSE as optional
  add-ons. The owner already allowed SFSE; the open point is whether the *base* needs it. One decision closes all four.
- **Host planet now vs later.** world-and-planet keeps Mars (today's test host) only until the census and the `EOVR`
  probe report; the owner's target is an Earth-like planet either way.

## Owner decisions that unlock the most (one line each; full options in the files)

| # | decision | recommended default (to argue with) | IDs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Voice audio: convert the player's files, subtitles only, re-voice? And codsworth_voice.py? | subtitles only for NPCs until Bethesda answers in writing; keep the script as a private test, out of release packaging | REL-26, REL-27, MG-03, PS-32 |
| 2 | Contact Bethesda and Nexus before the Nexus release? | yes, written, specific questions, citing FNV to FO4 | REL-30, REL-31 |
| 3 | Data-only core with SFSE optional, or SFSE required? | data-only base, SFSE features as add-ons | VM-17, TT-04, PS-35, TT-39 |
| 4 | Which Fallout 4 versions the launcher accepts | 1.10.163 and current Steam 1.11.240 via data detection; CC files ignored | VM-01, VM-07, AP-52 |
| 5 | Starfield patch day | refuse on mismatch, "known good" table, previous build until we post support | VM-12, TT-01 |
| 6 | Host planet and layout | Earth via `EOVR` if the probe works, else a cloned planet; real coordinates | WP-01, WP-14 |
| 7 | The ship | fenced out for v1; scripted travel through one chokepoint | WP-27 |
| 8 | Player choice text | prompt plus full line | PS-01 |
| 9 | First public release | a walkable-world release before people and story | WP-38, REL-52 |
| 10 | Dates and money | no dates ("what works now"); no donations or crowdfunding | REL-47, REL-37 |
| 11 | Licence split | MIT repo, GPL-3 notice on Mutagen-linked binaries | REL-01 |
| 12 | Naming | a neutral name, no Vault Boy or Pip-Boy art | REL-25 |

## Cheapest experiments that close the most (a list; nothing runs now)

Offline first:
1. **Licence reading pass** (GPL FAQ, Wwise, SFSE, Bethesda EULA, Microsoft Services Agreement): narrows 11 REL questions.
2. **Planet census** of Starfield.esm, Shattered Space and SFBGS00x (PNDT, BIOM, overlay components): WP-05/09/10/24.
3. **Spriggit and Mutagen round trip** on our current ESMs: TT-15/16/17.
4. **Offline record scan of Fallout4.esm** for player-spoken lines, dialogue structure and karma-like data: PS-04/05/13/24/30.
5. **Asset census and convert-everything failure count**: AP-01/05/32.
6. **FO3/NV masters through Mutagen and xEdit** (is ObScript source text present?): MG multi-game spike.

Read-only PC probes (through the coordinator, when the PC is free):
7. **FO4 BA2 header bytes** of a current install: VM-02/03, AP-52.
8. **Timed FaceFX compile of 1,000 FO4 WAVs** with a resume test: PS-08 to PS-11, AP-41 to AP-43.
9. **One Debug-probe launch**: which `Debug` test functions work in retail: TT-25/26.
10. **One terrain-only island overlay through `EOVR`** with gravity, an ocean biome and a map marker: WP-08/17/23/26/28.
11. **Crash logger A/B** on the known Havok assert: TT-23.

## Wave 3 (next)

Cross-link questions that block each other across all twelve files (one dependency table), fold in the phase threads'
next revisions and the queued CK command-line PC job, and chase the gaps that remain.
