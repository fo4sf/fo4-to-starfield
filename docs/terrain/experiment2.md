# Terrain experiment 2: real Commonwealth heights around Red Rocket as native Starfield terrain

Author: Claude, 2026-10-11. Branch `claude/terrain-exp2` (built on `claude/terrain-architecture` (PR #57) with
`claude/terrain-source` (PR #56) merged in). Status: **built and checked offline, staged, not deployed, not run in game**.

Labels: **verified** = measured here, number given; **supported** = supported hypothesis; **unresolved** = not known.
Offline checks are not in-game acceptance.

> **In-game update (2026-10-11, unattended runner; evidence in `C:\Modding\testqueue\terrain_*`).** Label added:
> **refuted** = contradicted by a measurement. This experiment as staged here (loose BTD, no planet registration)
> **cannot show the Commonwealth heights** and was not run:
> - loose files are disabled on this install (`Starfield.ini` has `sResourceDataDirsFinal=STRINGS\`), so a loose BTD
>   is never read (**verified**);
> - a worldspace's own BTD only applies to an overlay **activated** on a planet (PNDT `CNAM`); unregistered plugin
>   worldspaces show procedural planet ground, they do not fall through (**verified**, experiment 1: World01 and
>   World02 read identical heights 4.18 / 11.86 / 15.98 m);
> - activation merges the cells at a whole-cell offset plus a Z offset (vanilla LC172World -500 / -2300 m, Z -3.62 m;
>   exp2b -1200 / -2700 m), so hypothesis H below is **refuted** in its absolute form (see "What it tests").
>
> Its successor exp2b (PR #64: Mars registration, BTD packed in the plugin's BA2) read a flat -116.00 m, the BTD's
> minimum (raw 0), at all 14 probes (`terrain_exp2b`). Cause, as a **supported hypothesis** with a rerun pending: the
> BTD was zlib-compressed inside the BA2, while all 2,112 vanilla BTDs are stored; `exp_install.py` now packs with
> `-compression=None` (branch `claude/test-queue`). Summary of all runs: [architecture.md](architecture.md) (PR #57).

## What it tests
Experiment 1 ([architecture.md](architecture.md), section 5) asks whether a plugin worldspace loads its own BTD at
all, by record path or by name, and at what height scale, using flat test pads. Experiment 2 is the next step on
the same mechanism: **the real Fallout 4 terrain around the Red Rocket truck stop, at absolute positions, in one
29 x 29-cell native BTD**. It answers:

1. Does a large real-terrain BTD (27.6 MB, 841 cells) load and render like the 5 x 5 test BTD?
2. Hypothesis **H**: BTD height = world z in metres, and FO4 positions and heights convert at 70 units per metre
   (the repo's object scale). Then a player dropped at FO4 vertex (x, y) / 70 lands at FO4 height / 70.
   **Refuted in this absolute form** (in game, 2026-10-11): an activated overlay is merged at a whole-cell XY offset
   plus a Z offset (vanilla LC172World: -500 / -2300 m, Z -3.62 m under Relative alignment). Only the relative form
   can hold: heights measured against an anchor in the overlay's own frame, which is how exp2b measures. On vanilla
   LC172World that form matched the BTD within 0.02 m in the authored cell (**verified**). Whether Absolute alignment
   (`INAM` 1, exp2b) removes the offsets is **unresolved**.
3. Grid rule (supported, from PR #57): the BTD's south-west sample is n // 2 cells west and south of the world
   origin, with 100 m cells, 128 samples per cell and row 0 at the south edge. In game this can hold only in the
   overlay's own frame (see 2).
4. Are there steps at the LOD0 block borders (Starfield 100 m cells) or at FO4 cell borders?

It was built so that it works **whichever BTD lookup experiment 1 finds**. The SFBK `ANAM` record path and the
worldspace EditorID name both lead to `Data\TERRAIN\FO4CW_Commonwealth.btd`, as for experiment 1's `FO4TX_World01`.
In game neither lookup is used without a planet registration (**verified**), so this staging needs exp2b's Mars
plugin and a packed BTD.

## Staged files (`C:\Modding\staging\terrain_exp2`, outside the repo)

| File | Bytes | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `FO4TerrainExp2.esm` | 36,742 | master Starfield.esm. The WRLD, SFBK, cells and COC ref below, with its own FormIDs from 0x800 and nothing shared with FO4Port.esm |
| `Data\Terrain\FO4CW_Commonwealth.btd` | 27,612,888 | 29 x 29 cells, 3,712 x 3,712 samples, version 6, heights -116..142 m |
| `plan.json` | 1,761 | runner input: COC, 14 check points, `drop_z` 150, `beyond` |
| `expected.json` | 11,518 | hypothesis, grid, coverage, LTEX, every point with metadata and the offline check |
| `exp2_params.json` | 487 | numbers the plugin builder reads (written by the Python step) |
| `README.txt` | 2,812 | manual console steps |
| `preview.png` | 270,403 | heightmap with the BTD cell grid and the check points (north up) |

The layout fits `scripts/game/exp_install.py` (branch `claude/test-queue`). That tool activates only the first
`.esm` and copied the `Data\` tree, here a single BTD, as loose files. Loose files are not read on this install
(**verified**), so the installer now packs the tree into `<plugin> - Main.ba2` (`--pack`, stored with
`-compression=None`). `plan.json` and the other top-level files are not copied into the game.

## Grid and coverage
- Region that must have real heights: the PR #56 patch (FO4 cells x -18..-17, y 18..19, which is
  x -1053.26..-936.23 m and y 1053.26..1170.29 m) plus 300 m on every side. That gives x -1353.26..-636.23 m and
  y 753.26..1470.29 m.
- The grid is anchored at the world origin, so it must reach x = -1353 m on the west and y = +1470 m on the north.
  The smallest n that does is **n = 29** (`terrain_grid.choose_n`). With n = 29:
  - the samples run from -1400.00 to 1499.22 m on both axes;
  - Starfield cells **-14..14** (841);
  - this is within the vanilla maximum of 100 x 100 cells for a BTD, but about twice (per side) the largest BTD
    behind a vanilla overlay, 14 x 14 (NewAtlantis, SettleWaggonerFarm; QA raw walk on PR #57). Untested size.
- FO4 cells read: **x -24..25, y -24..25 (2,500 cells)**. That is every FO4 cell under the BTD footprint, so the
  whole BTD holds real Commonwealth heights.
  - The minimum for the region alone would be x -24..-11, y 12..25 (196 cells). The other ~75% of the BTD would
    then repeat the nearest FO4 edge height in long streaks.
  - Reading the whole footprint costs a few seconds and keeps the area around the test true to the Commonwealth.
  - Edge clamping is still implemented and unit-tested: `--extract region`, or any sample outside the cells read,
    takes the nearest edge height. There is no extrapolation and no cliff.
- Resampling: bilinear on the merged FO4 vertex grid, done separably (`terrain_grid.resample_bilinear`), at each
  sample's world position times 70. Heights are FO4 units / 70.
  - FO4's own triangle split is still **unresolved** (PR #56). Bilinear is the choice for now.
- FO4 seams in the cells read (**verified**): 4,900 neighbour pairs, of which 42 vertices do not match. The worst is
  152 units (2.2 m), between cells (-15,-1) and (-14,-1), about 1.4 km from Red Rocket. The merged grid takes the
  south/west cell's copy.
- DLC overrides are not applied: `DLCRobot.esm` changes LAND in FO4 cell (-1, 5) by up to 32 units (0.46 m), inside
  this footprint but far from the check points (QA review on PR #56).
- Heights -114.46..140.67 m. The header range is -116..142 m, so the **16-bit quantisation step is 3.937 mm**.

## Ground texture
- **`001235C2` `LDirtFootprints01`** (`Materials\Terrain\DirtFootprints01.mat`). In a survey of the quadrant maps of
  all 753 top-level vanilla BTDs (scratch `ltex_survey.py`, decoding rule from fo76utils `getCellTextureSet`), it is:
  - the base texture of 2,334,675 cell quadrants, 2,268,003 of them with no other layer;
  - the next most common base is `00010861` `LDefault006Base`, with 280,277 quadrants.
- `TempJemisonWorld`, the vanilla 100 x 100-cell world without a planet, uses it as its only texture.
- The BTD copies that file's layout exactly (**verified** by reading it):
  - its 7-entry LTEX table (`00010861 00010860 0001085F 0001085E 0001085D 0001085C 001235C2`);
  - quadrant bytes `1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` (table index 7 - 1 = 6, which is `001235C2`);
  - all texture weights 0.
- No FO4 textures yet.

## Plugin `FO4TerrainExp2.esm`
- Built by `dotnet/TerrainExp2` with Mutagen. The template is the same as experiment 1's, the Mars landing world
  `LC172World` (02DF8C) and its block `OverlayBlockLC172World` (102382), so the two experiments differ only in the
  BTD and the cell grid. Biome, climate, water and flags are the template's (`SmallWorld`, no water: block `WHGT`
  -3.4e38).
- Raw record walk of the written file (`make_exp2.py check`, independent of Mutagen; **verified**):

| Record | Fields |
|---|---|
| WRLD `01000801` `FO4CW_Commonwealth` | overlay component `BFCB` `SNAM`/`PNAM` (template) `BNAM` = `01000800` (the SFBK); second `BNAM` = `002A3777` (Mars biome, template); `NAM0` = (-1400, -1400), `NAM9` = (1500, 1500) |
| SFBK `01000800` `FO4CW_CommonwealthBlock` | `ANAM` = `Data\TERRAIN\FO4CW_Commonwealth.btd`, `DNAM` = 29 x 29, `ENAM` = -116 / 142 (= BTD header, as in vanilla), `FNAM` = 8 raw border heights |
| CELL x 842 | 841 exterior cells -14..14 (empty) + the persistent top cell |
| CELL `0100088F` `FO4CW_RedRocketSpawn` | XCLC (-10, 11) |
| REFR `01000890` `FO4CW_RedRocketSpawnMarker` | base `000032` COCMarkerHeading at (-989.0286, 1147.2000, 107.1434) |

Details:
- `NAM0`/`NAM9` (object bounds) are raw metres. Mutagen shows them divided by 4096, so the template's -0.0488 /
  0.0732 are raw -200 / 300 m, matching its cells -2..2. Writing -1400/4096 produced raw -1400.0 (**verified**).
- `FNAM` ("connections") holds the corners and edge midpoints, SW, S, SE, E, NE, N, NW, W. Only the first value
  matches vanilla (the SW corner, 3 of 3 blocks checked: lc172world, akilacity, newatlantis). The meaning of the
  other seven is **unresolved**. It should not matter for a worldspace that is never blended into a planet.
- Spawn: the Red Rocket building `000211C0` origin is FO4 (-69232, 80304, 7360). Divided by 70 that is
  (-989.0286, 1147.2), in Starfield cell (-10, 11). The decoded BTD ground there is 105.1434 m (FO4 7360 / 70 =
  105.1429). The marker is 2 m higher, at 107.1434. The building itself is not placed in this experiment.

## Check points (`plan.json`)
- Every point is an exact FO4 vertex: position = vertex units / 70, expect = vertex height / 70.
- A vertex is eligible only if the decoded BTD gives its height back within one quantisation step under all three
  interpolation rules (bilinear and both triangle splits). So the expectation does not depend on how the engine
  interpolates BTD samples, and FO4's triangle split does not matter at a vertex.
- `shift sens.` is how much a half-sample (0.39 m) grid shift would move the reading on that slope.
- `drop_z` = 150 m (the highest point is 121.71 m). `beyond` = (-1500, 1147.2), 100 m west of the BTD's west edge.

## Offline verification (verified)
- `make_exp2.py check` re-decodes the written BTD with `src/fo4sf/btd.py`. It checks each of the 14 plan points
  under bilinear and both triangle splits. The **max error is 3.221 mm**, against a step of 3.937 mm. The worst
  point is seam_fo4_west; bilinear alone gives 2.919 mm.
  - Spawn ground: 105.1434 m.
  - Two builds from scratch gave byte-identical BTD and esm files (SHA-256 compared).
- Header and LTEX checks:
  - range -116 / 142;
  - LTEX table as above, quadrant `1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`, weights max 0;
  - re-decoding is exact by construction: the writer and reader round trip is tested in `tests/test_btd.py`.
- All 4,225 FO4 vertices of the patch (bilinear on the decoded BTD against the FO4 vertex height). Context only:
  these are not the plan points.

  | Slope | Vertices | Median | p99 | Max |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0-10 deg | 1,769 | 1.20 cm | 9.1 cm | 18 cm |
  | 10-20 deg | 1,709 | 1.76 cm | 11.2 cm | 22 cm |
  | 20-30 deg | 619 | 2.32 cm | 18.0 cm | 36 cm |
  | 30-45 deg | 110 | 3.53 cm | 20.6 cm | 26 cm |
  | over 45 deg | 18 | 55 cm | 136 cm | **1.42 m**, at a 75 deg cliff |

  A 0.78 m grid cannot hold FO4's sharp cliff edges. If that matters in game, the fix is to sample FO4's triangles
  (once the split is known) or to use a finer grid. It is not a bug: shifting the BTD grid by half a sample or a
  whole sample raises the median from 1.58 cm to 5.55 cm and 10.35 cm, so the generator and the checker agree on
  the alignment. This check is internal consistency, not in-game proof.

## Running it
**Unattended runner** (branch `claude/test-queue`). Run it after experiment 1, never with both installed:

    python scripts/game/testqueue.py plan-terrain --staging <FO4Port build dir> --exp-dir C:\Modding\staging\terrain_exp2 ^
        --out <queue dir> --plugins FO4TerrainExp2.esm
    python scripts/game/testqueue.py run --queue <queue dir>

- The runner COCs to `FO4CW_RedRocketSpawn` (`coc <exterior cell EditorID>` works in game; `cow`,
  `coc <worldspace>` and `player.moveto <non-persistent ref>` do not, **verified**).
- For each point it teleports to (x, y, 150), waits, and reads `player.getpos`.
- It reports PASS when every point is within 0.5 m and within 2 m horizontally.
  - As planned this judged absolute z, which the merge offset rules out (H, above). The runner on
    `claude/test-queue` now shifts the points by the measured merge offset and judges heights relative to it; for
    exp2b it falls back to the arrival point, because our anchor reads its unmerged local position.
  - PASS/FAIL cannot decide the grid rule: the 0.5 m tolerance is larger than every point's half-sample
    `shift sens.` (0.09-0.21 m). Judge the rule from the raw numbers, with the expectation evaluated at the read
    (x, y), not the planned one (on LC172World one probe landed 0.49 m from its planned x).
- It records a screenshot at `beyond`.

**By hand:** `C:\Modding\staging\terrain_exp2\README.txt`. In short (as planned; see the notes):
1. Install the esm and the BTD. In game this needs the BTD in `FO4TerrainExp2 - Main.ba2`, stored uncompressed
   (loose files are not read), and the planet registration plugin from exp2b (PR #64).
2. `tgm`, then `coc FO4CW_RedRocketSpawn`, then `player.getpos z`, which should give about 105.14 (in game: plus
   the overlay's Z offset, and x/y shifted by the whole-cell merge offset).
3. For each point: `player.setpos x/y/z`, land, then `player.getpos z` (shift x/y by the merge offset).
4. Look past x = -1400 m (overlay frame).

## Reading the result

| Observation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| All points within 0.5 m (relative to the overlay's offsets) | Real terrain loads; the relative form of H holds (the grid rule needs the raw numbers, see Running it). Next: the Red Rocket statics (below) |
| All off by one constant | vertical offset (a world height origin or the SFBK alignment fields `HNAM`/`INAM`) |
| Heights scaled (read / expect constant) | Height mapping differs: x8 is fo76utils' FIXME scale, 0.7 would mean 100 units per metre |
| Slope points off by up to their `shift sens.`, flat points right | half-sample grid shift: sample centres, not corners |
| One seam pair differs, the rest pass | LOD0 block stitching (seam_sf) or FO4 border handling (seam_fo4) |
| Fell through (NOTERRAIN) | The BTD did not load. Compare with experiment 1: size (27.6 MB, 29 cells), `SmallWorld` with 841 cells, or the lookup path. **Not what the game does:** an unregistered worldspace gets procedural planet ground, with a loose or a packed BTD (**verified**) |
| Flat at the BTD minimum (raw 0) everywhere | Registered, but the BTD's blocks were not decoded. Seen in exp2b (-116.00 m at all 14 probes); supported hypothesis: compressed BTD in the BA2 |
| Experiment 1 passes only with the Mars registration | Add the same `PNDT` entry for `FO4CW_Commonwealth` (an `FO4TerrainExp1_Mars.esm` copy). In game the registration is always required (**verified**); exp2b adds it |

## Next step (plan, not built): Red Rocket exterior statics in this worldspace
- `dotnet/Fo4Export` (Codex's, not changed here) exports **interior** cells only. `export <EditorID>` looks only at
  interior cells, and FO4 exterior cells mostly have no EditorID. Its `AllCells()` already walks worldspace cells,
  but only to resolve teleport dependencies.
- The exterior references already exist in the PR #56 tools:
  - `scripts/terrain/fo4_land_patch.py` writes `refs.json` with every REFR of the patch cells (1,315: base type and
    EditorID, position, rotation, scale);
  - `dotnet/Fo4Land` reads the same refs with Mutagen.
- Neither emits the schema v2 placement JSON that the cell converter consumes (model path, persistence, linked refs,
  teleports).
- `dotnet/PluginSpike` (Claude's) builds interior cells only (`Cell.Flag.IsInteriorCell`, interior blocks).
- Proposed order:
  1. A Claude-owned exterior exporter (an `export-exterior <world> <x0> <x1> <y0> <y1>` mode in `dotnet/Fo4Land`)
     that writes schema v2 JSON for FO4 cells x -18..-17, y 18..19. It should reuse Fo4Export's `ReferenceExport`
     by linking the source file, without editing it.
  2. Convert the referenced meshes with the existing asset pipeline.
  3. Teach PluginSpike to place those refs in `FO4CW_Commonwealth`. Each goes into the Starfield cell
     floor(x / 100 m), floor(y / 100 m), at FO4 position / 70, with z unchanged under H. The world blocks and
     sub-blocks are grouped as in TerrainExp2.
- If H holds, `RedRExt_Workshop01` lands with its floor exactly on the terrain: FO4 z 7360 = terrain, residual 0
  (PR #56), and 105.1429 m against the decoded BTD's 105.1434 m.

## Unknowns
1. Everything in game: whether our BTD is used at all once registered (exp2b came out flat at raw 0; rerun with a
   stored BTD pending), the relative form of H under Absolute alignment, the grid rule, seams, what lies beyond the
   edge. Answered: registration is required and loose BTDs are not read (**verified**, experiment 1).
2. Whether `SmallWorld` (copied from the 5 x 5 template) limits a 29 x 29 world (twice the largest activated vanilla
   overlay per side, 14 x 14), and whether all 841 empty cells are
   needed. In vanilla akilacity, 55 of its 81 BTD cells hold references (`SfInspect wcells`); whether the
   other 26 have empty CELL records was not checked.
3. The meaning of `FNAM` entries 2-8; the alignment fields (`HNAM`/`INAM`/`JNAM`) for a master worldspace.
4. FO4's triangle split, and cliff accuracy (above).

## Reproduce

    python scripts/terrain/make_exp2.py build --fo4 <Fallout4.esm> --sf-data <Starfield\Data> --out C:\Modding\staging\terrain_exp2
    dotnet run --project dotnet/TerrainExp2 -c Release -- <Starfield.esm> C:\Modding\staging\terrain_exp2
    python scripts/terrain/make_exp2.py check --sf-data <Starfield\Data> --out C:\Modding\staging\terrain_exp2
    python -m unittest tests.test_terrain_grid

The build step reads 2,500 FO4 cells and writes the 27.6 MB BTD in a few seconds. The scratch analysis scripts
(LTEX survey, FNAM comparison, error by slope) are not in the repo. Their outputs are in `C:\Modding\research\terrain\`.
