Scriptname FO4SF_Min00Quest extends Quest
{A cut-down "When Freedom Calls" (fo4-to-starfield, docs/mission/when-freedom-calls.md): the Concord raiders,
 Preston Garvey and the reward, driven by a one-second check instead of FO4's triggers, scenes and fragments.
 Stages: 10 started (find Preston), 20 the fight started, 30 the raiders are dead (talk to Preston), 40 talked to
 Preston (the reward), 200 complete. Every stage change and a status line every 5 s go to the user log
 "fo4sf_mission" (My Games\Starfield\Logs\Script\User\fo4sf_mission.0.log), the evidence of a run.}

Actor Property Preston Auto Const Mandatory
{Preston's placed actor (FO4SFMission.esm 0x802).}

Actor[] Property Raiders Auto Const Mandatory
{The Concord raiders' placed actors (FO4SFMission.esm 0x803 on).}

MiscObject Property Credits Auto Const Mandatory
{Starfield's credits: the reward that stands in for Fallout 4's caps.}

Actor Property Codsworth Auto Const
{Codsworth's placed actor (FO4SFMission.esm 0x811), None in a --no-codsworth build. Not part of the quest; moved with
 the others (Relocate).}

float Property MergeOffsetY = -2700.0 Auto Const
{The core world's merge offset (vmad_patch.MERGE_MEASURED, measured in game): the world the player walks in places the
 core's records at their local position + this; z unchanged. Persistent references of the core's persistent cell stay
 at their LOCAL position in the base world (probe (a), 16 Oct; in game 18 Oct: GetDistance to Preston stayed at float max
 with the player standing on his merged spot), so the quest moves its actors over (Relocate).}

float Property RelocateRadius = 800.0 Auto Const
{Move an actor only when the player stands outdoors within this many units of that actor's merged spot (its position +
 the merge offset). Coordinates alone cannot tell two exterior worlds apart; see docs/mission/when-freedom-calls.md.}

float Property RelocateGap = 1500.0 Auto Const
{...and Preston is farther than this from the player. Unmoved he reads float max (another world, 18 Oct 13:25) or about
 2,955 (the offset's length: same world at his local spot, 18 Oct 14:40); moved he is within RelocateRadius.}

int Property RewardCount = 100 Auto Const
{Fallout 4 gives 100 caps (DialogueConcordArea stage 40).}

float Property CodsworthCheck = 5.0 Auto Const
{Seconds between Codsworth's own relocation checks (KeepCodsworth).}

float Property EngageRadius = 60.0 Auto Const
{The fight starts when the player comes this close (m) to a living raider, as FO4's DN092 StartCombat on its ambush.}

float Property TalkRadius = 3.0 Auto Const
{Standing this close (m) to Preston counts as talking to him once the raiders are dead (no dialogue ported yet).}

 reachable" skipped the move. A moved actor's position + the offset is far from the player, so nobody is offset twice;
