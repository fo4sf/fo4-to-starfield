Scriptname FOCC_B0 Hidden
{Console entry points of B0, the plugin bridge spike (docs/combined-core-cpp-port.md section 4, the owner's call of
 28 Oct 2026: stack A first, B as the backup; docs/spikes/combined-core-probes.md, section B0). Each resolves the probe
 quest through FOCC_Probe.Q and answers on the "focc" user log, as every probe does.

                              route (stack B) the value the plugin wrote by its name

                              the native (stack A), 0 when nothing did (an unbound native yields 0; Papyrus.0.log
                              names it). The ping line is also what a log-tailing plugin (stack B) reads.
 Game.GetGameSettingInt is declared in Starfield's Game.psc (lines 217 to 221 on the PC, 28 Oct 2026); FOCC.Ping in
 FOCC.psc here. Compiled on its own by make_combined_probe.py (compile_b0.txt), so a refusal leaves only B0 out.}
