Scriptname FO4SF_MapMarkers extends Quest
{Puts the Commonwealth's map markers into the world the player walks in (fo4-to-starfield, docs/terrain/map-markers.md
 "Markers in the merged world"). The markers are persistent references of FO4TerrainCore.esm's overlay world, and a
 persistent reference of that world stays at its LOCAL position in the base world (door probe (a), 16 Oct; the
 mission's actors, 18 Oct), while the player walks in a world made at run time (FF0054C8 in the mission log) that
 places the core's records at local + the merge offset: no icon showed (owner, 19 Oct, v6). Every Interval seconds,
 with the player outdoors inside the overlay's merged extent, each marker that is not at its merged spot in the
 player's world is enabled and moved there (MoveTo onto the player with the difference as the offset, the form
 FO4SF_LoadDoor and the mission's Relocate use, but keeping the reference's own rotation: the list also holds the
 landing spot's pad, whose facing is the ship's). The player is read again before every move, and a pass stops once
 they are indoors, in another world or outside the extent. A reference the game will not move (the landing pad) is
 left alone for the rest of the session. Every move goes to the user log "fo4sf_map"
 (My Games\Starfield\Logs\Script\User\fo4sf_map.0.log). The map lists only the markers that are in a world when
 the player enters it, and these are moved in after, so once every marker is in place the first quest reloads the
 world once, behind a black screen (HopMarker).}

ObjectReference[] Property Markers Auto Const Mandatory
{The core's MapMarker references (dotnet/MapMarkers fills them from the core plugin), then the plugin's own: its
 markers (--extra) and the landing spot's pad, trigger, marker and heading (--landing).}

float[] Property LocalX Auto Const Mandatory
float[] Property LocalY Auto Const Mandatory
float[] Property LocalZ Auto Const Mandatory
{Each marker's written (local) position, so the target does not depend on where a marker was last moved to.}

float Property MergeOffsetX = -1200.0 Auto Const
float Property MergeOffsetY = -2700.0 Auto Const
{vmad_patch.MERGE_MEASURED (measured in game); z unchanged.}

float Property MinX = -4400.0 Auto Const
float Property MaxX = 2000.0 Auto Const
float Property MinY = -5900.0 Auto Const
float Property MaxY = 500.0 Auto Const
{The overlay's merged extent (local -3200..3200 m + the merge offset). Coordinates alone cannot tell two exterior
 worlds apart: a player standing outdoors in another world inside this box would pull the markers there.}

float Property Tolerance = 5.0 Auto Const
{A marker within this many units of its merged spot (x, y), in the player's world, counts as placed.}

float Property ZTolerance = 0.05 Auto Const
{The same for height: a save made before a build that lifted LocalZ holds the markers at the old height, and the
 moved markers' saved positions outlive the records (docs/JOURNAL.md, changed references); a marker more than this
 far from its LocalZ is moved again. Half the lift step: dotnet/MapMarkers accepts --z-lift in steps of 0.1 m only,
 so any change between builds is at least 0.1 m and is seen, while a landed move (within 0.01 m, fo4sf_map.0.log
 22 Oct) is not moved again.}

float Property SameWorld = 100000.0 Auto Const
{GetDistance above this means the marker is in another world (it reads float max there, 18 Oct).}

float Property Interval = 2.0 Auto Const

int Property MaxMoves = 40 Auto Const
{Stop moving after this many moves in one game session (a move that never lands would otherwise repeat every
 Interval). The count is saved state; it starts over when a build changes the markers' count or their height (budgetN,
 budgetZ), so a later lift reaches a save whose budget an earlier placement spent (Codex on #483), and at every game
 session (NewSession), so markers a session left in the wrong place are put right in the next one.}

int Property LandingPadID = 0x007145 Auto Const
{ShipLandingMarker_80m_Large (Starfield.esm), the landing spot's pad. dotnet/MapMarkers lists the landing spot last, as
 pad, trigger, marker, heading, all four in one quest, so the pad is fourth from its quest's end and the marker two
 places after it.}

bool Property BorderSignal = True Auto Const
{Write "border=off" / "border=on" to this log when the player enters or leaves our world, for the SFSE plugin
 FO4SFBorder (sfse/FO4SFBorder/README.md), which turns the game's border regions off only while the line says off.}

ObjectReference Property HopMarker Auto Const
{The reload's stop: the marker in this plugin's own small interior (dotnet/MapMarkers --reload, FO4SF_MapMarkersHop), on
 the first quest only. The map lists only the markers that are in a world when the player enters it, and these are moved
 in after: no marker showed on the map or could be discovered by walking past it until a trip to Cydonia and back
 (owner, 2026-10-31), and the world keeps them meanwhile (the same instance and no marker moved again after such a trip,
 fo4sf_map.0.log 24 Oct). So once every quest's markers are in place and some went in after the player entered, the
 first quest takes the player here and straight back to the same spot with the screen black, at most HopLimit times a
 session; only in our world as Border learns it, so only with BorderSignal on. None: never.}

float Property HopDelay = 10.0 Auto Const
{Seconds the player must have been outdoors in that world first: a start that places them in steps is done by then (the
 new game's arrival SetPosition, then its landing check 3 s later: FO4SF_NewGameQuest.psc CheckLanding).}

float Property HopWait = 10.0 Auto Const
{Seconds each leg of the reload waits for the player to arrive (Utility.Wait: a loading screen does not count).}

int Property HopLimit = 1 Auto Const
{Reloads per game session: one that does not help (a world made again on the way back moves every marker in again)
 would otherwise repeat.}

bool Property HoldDark = True Auto Const
{The first quest keeps the screen black from an arrival until its reload is back, so the first map the player opens
 lists every marker (option A put to the owner, 2026-10-31): it fades out at its first marker that comes in late
 within HoldWindow seconds of the player entering the world, and the reload's way back fades in. False: the reload
 only (a short blink).}

float Property HoldWindow = 15.0 Auto Const
{Seconds after the player entered the world in which a late marker still starts the hold; later, they are playing. The
 new game's ride lands at its anchor, off the map, and on the arrival 4.3 s later; the first quest's first move came
 7.2 s after the ride (31 Oct retest: rt 125.8, 130.1, 133.0).}

float Property HoldMax = 60.0 Auto Const
{The longest hold, in seconds: the screen comes back then even without the reload (31 Oct retest: the reload was back
 about 14 s after the last marker went in, about 35 s after the arrival).}
