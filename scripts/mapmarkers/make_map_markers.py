"""Stage FO4SFMapMarkers.esm: the quest that puts the core's map markers into the merged world the player walks in
(docs/terrain/map-markers.md "Markers in the merged world").

usage:
  python scripts/mapmarkers/make_map_markers.py stage --core <FO4TerrainCore.esm> --out <NEW folder>
                                                     [--compiler <PapyrusCompiler.exe>] [--content-resources <zip>]
                                                     [--z-lift <m>] [--world control|nosmall|city]
                                                     [--fo4-map-markers <export.json>] [--landing <x> <y>]
                                                     [--landing-name <name>] [--core-stage <folder>]
      0. with --fo4-map-markers (the owner's "more location markers", 2026-10-23): the rest of FO4's named
         Commonwealth markers, picked as make_core64c.py stage --fo4-map-markers picks them for a core
         (fo4sf.map_markers.load_fo4_markers and extra_markers: 200 m inside the land, none on a same-named fixed or
         kept marker within 100 m), z the core's BTD ground, into <out>/extra_markers.json (the left out with their
         reason in map_markers_left_out.json). --core-stage is the folder that staged the core: its overlays_params.json
         (bounds, the BTD path, the fixed markers) and its BTD; its copy of the core must be --core, byte for byte;
         with --landing (the owner's "temp ship landing spot", 2026-10-23): a pad at getpos (x, y), the merged frame
         the game and the owner's snapshots report, and LandingOverlay01's trigger, "Landing Area" marker and heading
         around it (fo4sf.map_markers.landing_spot, heights from the same BTD), into <out>/landing.json;
      1. dotnet/MapMarkers build: the plugin (one start-game-enabled quest carrying FO4SF_MapMarkers, its Markers the
         core's MapMarker REFRs, LocalX / LocalY / LocalZ their positions as overridden below), plus an override of
         each of those REFRs: the marker's own name on the map (no UseLocationName flag) and the arrival lifted
         --z-lift metres (a multiple of 0.1; default the tool's 2.5) above the core's sampled terrain height; the
         override's containers, copies of the core's WRLD and persistent CELL, override the core's records too, so a
         stage belongs to one core build (check fails a stale one), and --world takes the WRLD copy from
         dotnet/BorderProbe's variants (the border settling test): control as the core's, nosmall without
         SmallWorld, city without SmallWorld and HNAM 5; with step 0, --extra adds those markers as this plugin's
         own REFRs, with one LCSR row each in an override of the core's Location, after the core's in the quests,
         and --landing adds the landing spot's four REFRs and its three LCSR rows, after those in the quests;
      2. the Papyrus compile of FO4SF_MapMarkers.psc (base sources from the Creation Kit's ContentResources.zip, as
         scripts/bridge/make_bridge.py), the .pex into <out>/Data/Scripts;
      3. dotnet/MapMarkers check: the plugin read back against the core (offline_check.txt); core.json (the core's
         sha256, which the installer requires in Data); README.txt.
Install (game closed), with the core it was built from active (its own record, beside exp_install's experiment):
  python scripts/game/map_markers_install.py install --dir <out> --starfield <game>
The plugin names the core's references by FormID, so it is rebuilt with every core build.
