"""L3 news: the simulation's events as short lines of our own writing, for terminals and on-screen text.

The design's default for seeing the off-screen world is "radio and terminal text first" in our own
words (combined-core design, docs/research/framework/combined-core.md, CC-30 and "The legal
fence", which lists terminal and radio news text we author as ours). Spoken news waits on the voice
question, so this module makes text only. The event feed itself comes from sim.news_for, so a place
only reports what has had time to reach it along the routes.

Templates are plain, neutral English keyed by event kind; they quote no game's writing. Unknown kinds
are skipped so a newer simulation never breaks an older presenter. Output is deterministic: newest
first, ties kept in event order, exact repeats collapsed.
