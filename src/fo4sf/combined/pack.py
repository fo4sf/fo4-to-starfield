"""L5 content packs: JSON that only ever adds places, settlements, factions and routes to a WorldState.

A pack is a dict with the lists "places", "settlements", "factions" and "routes" (each optional) whose entries
are the keyword arguments of the matching model dataclass. validate_pack lists every problem it finds in plain
words; load_pack refuses a pack with any problem, so a half-loaded world never happens. A second pack may refer
to things an earlier pack loaded (a route to its gateway, a relation to its faction): that is how a second
region plugs in without the first knowing about it.
