"""L2 simulation prototype: advances the world state on game time, deterministically.

Paper prototype to tune rules before any game work. Every number here is a
placeholder to argue with, not a balance decision. The RNG is seeded from
(seed, hour), so a run resumed from a saved state replays exactly; every draw
comes from that per-tick RNG and dicts are walked in sorted order.

Lessons from the first prototype that this version encodes: growth needs a role
rule and a beds cap, faction strength needs a sink (daily upkeep), capture must
hurt the settlement, factions prefer to retake what they lost, and caravans can
be raided so supply lines are breakable.
