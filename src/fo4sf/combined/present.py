"""L3 presentation planner: what the simulation says is near the player, as abstract spawn slots.

The design makes L3 the only layer that spawns things: it materializes what L2 says is near the player
and dissolves it back into data when the player leaves, with no permanent spawned references
(combined-core design, docs/research/framework/combined-core.md, layer rules). The radius idea is
A-Life's: full detail within a short range, coarse simulation beyond it (combined-core-notes/
gamma-anatomy.md, 2.4, verified for X-Ray). Here the range is route hours on the L1 graph, not
metres, because L1 has no coordinates.

This module is pure data: plan() reads a WorldState and returns a Plan of slots; diff() compares two
plans so a replan only spawns and dissolves the difference. Nothing here mutates the world, and
nothing here is engine code: an adapter later turns slots into alias fills and PlaceAtMe calls. Every
number is a placeholder to tune; the actor budget stands in for the engine's (combined-core-notes/
engine-feasibility.md names "actor-count budgets" as a risk without a measured figure).
