"""Turn a seed draft (seed.py) into a pack that runs: holders, factions, homes, routes and settlement stats by rules.

generate(draft, rules) returns (pack, report). The pack passes pack.validate_pack, loads into a WorldState and runs
under sim.run with the balance invariants kept (homes and story locks never change hands, which the simulation
enforces by construction). Route hours are data-relative (each world's median route distance is a placeholder number
of hours), so no claim about a game's units is needed. Deterministic: the same draft and rules give byte-identical JSON (sorted walks, no
randomness, no clock).

Every number and name in DEFAULT_RULES is a PLACEHOLDER to argue with, except where a comment names the first real
run (owner's PC, 2026-10-21, Fallout4.esm + DLCRobot.esm + DLCworkshop01.esm) as support. Keyword and faction
editor ids are read from the draft; nothing here states what a game's records contain beyond the keyword names that
run listed (LocTypeWorkshop, LocTypeWorkshopSettlement, LocTypeSettlement, LocEncRaiders, LocEncSuperMutants,
LocEncGhouls, and from its seed-pack report LocEncGunners plus the then-unmapped LocEncBoS, Bugs, CoA, Deathclaw,
Mirelurks, Molerats, Robots, Synths, Wildlife) and the ref type WorkshopRefType. The pack's factions are its own small set (settlers plus each enemy
the rules map), not the draft's hundreds of FACT records; FACT relation data is carried only where an edid matches a
rules pattern, otherwise the placeholder relations apply.
