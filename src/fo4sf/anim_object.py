"""An animated Fallout 4 object that is no door, on one of Starfield's activator graphs (FAL-489 variant D, the Vault 111 console).

The game's own activators (variant A, 12 Nov) are a skeleton rig plus one .af clip per graph state and an .afx descriptor per
clip, in the record's CNAM folder, under a graph such as activatorstategraph01.agx whose clip slots are StateA_Idle,
StateA_Play, StateB_Idle and StateB_Play. This module is the part the door recipe lacks: it picks which of the object's
sequences feed which slot, makes the one-frame hold clips the Idle slots need, and writes the .afx descriptors (the vanilla
shape: is_state, tag, filename, and an optional audio frame carrying a sound). Everything else is the door path's:
door_motion.inspect (sequences -> clip slots), door_rig.plan (rig), native_door (the .rig and .af through CALUMI) and
convert_static.convert_multipart_door (the model, one keyframed body per moving bone).

Unread (said, not assumed): which slot the graph plays for which input event; whether the Idle slots want is_state 1; whether
a hold clip of one frame is accepted; whether the engine takes the audio frame without a sound record the game knows.
