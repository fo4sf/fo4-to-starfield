"""Launcher settings: the optional pieces the player turns on and off before playing, each with what it costs
(owner, 2026-10-21: "let the launcher be where I can toggle it off and on, and more settings of that sort that cause
RAM use"). One JSON file per player, written only by `launcher.py settings --set` and read by `launcher.py play`.

Every setting starts at the value that changes nothing on the PC (crash watcher off, bridge and Papyrus logging left
as they are), so a fresh install plays exactly as before until the player turns something on. Once the watcher is on,
it also saves a dump at every exit unless crash_watch.dump_on_exit is turned off.
