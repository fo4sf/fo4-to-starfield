"""`launcher.py play`: apply the launcher settings, start Starfield, and (when the crash watcher is on) watch it from
start to exit (owner, 2026-10-21: "rebuild the crash watcher to be allowed to start and close with the game").

The old watcher (C:\\Modding\\tools\\crashwatch.cmd on the owner's PC) was a loop the player started by hand:
`procdump64.exe -accepteula -e 1 -f "80000003" -ma -n 1 -w Starfield.exe <folder>`, again and again, all day. It
caught the museum crashes (three full dumps, ACCESS_VIOLATION at Starfield.exe+0x2bf016b), but:
  - it ran whether or not anyone was playing, and only stopped when someone killed it;
  - `-w` attached the instant Starfield.exe appeared, the leading lead for Steam's "ERROR 84" launch failures;
  - full dumps only (about 18 GB each);
  - a silent exit (no exception, no Windows error report: 21 Oct 11:03:25) left nothing behind at all.

Here the watcher lives exactly as long as one game:
  1. the settings are applied with the game closed (bridge held off or put back, Papyrus logging);
  2. the game is started (Steam or Starfield.exe, `route`);
  3. once Starfield.exe has stayed up `settle_s` seconds, ProcDump attaches to that process id (no `-w`), with the
     old watcher's triggers (`-e 1 -f 80000003`: the assertion stop, and unhandled exceptions, which caught the three
     museum dumps) and, when asked, `-t` (a dump at any exit);
  4. this process holds its own handle on the game, so when the game ends, by a crash, a silent exit or a quit, it
     logs the exit code and its name to crashwatch.log, with the dumps written in that run;
  5. ProcDump detaches and exits by itself when the game ends. It is never killed here: a dump cut short is useless
     (docs/PLAY-AND-TEST.md); if it is still writing after `dump_wait_s`, play says so and leaves it running.
With the watcher off, play still starts the game and prints its exit code (a handle costs nothing).

Everything Windows-specific goes through a `System` object, so the flow is tested on synthetic stand-ins.
