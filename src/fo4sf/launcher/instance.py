"""The FO4SF game folder: a separate copy of Starfield that is always FO4SF, beside the player's own Starfield and its mod
packs (owner, 2026-11-01: "stay FO4SF all the time make a separate area then actual starfield so people can keep their
own mod packs for that"). Design and the steps after this one: docs/ai/fo4sf-instance.md.

This module plans and makes the folder; it never writes in the player's install.
* Every file of the install is hard-linked into the new folder, so it costs no disk (a hard link is the same file under a
  second name). That needs the same drive: on another drive it refuses, since a copy would cost the whole game.
* INI files (Starfield.ini, the Low to Ultra presets, an SFSE plugin's settings in a kept Data folder, ...) are copied
  instead, at every level, so the FO4SF folder's settings can change without changing the player's (an edit through a
  hard link would change both). A copy goes to a temporary name first and takes its own name only when complete.
* Data keeps only the game's own files: the plugins the game loads by itself (fo4sf.core.loadset.built_in) and the files
  named after them ("Starfield - Textures01.ba2", "SFBGS003 - Main.ba2", ...). Everything else in Data (the player's
  mods, our own installs, loose folders, SFSE plugins) is left out and listed, unless a Data folder is kept by name.
* The record FO4SF-instance.json in the new folder lists what was made; a run that stopped goes on from there, and a
  file that is already there and is not the one it would make is refused, never overwritten. Every file already there
  is checked before the record changes, so a refused rerun leaves a finished folder finished.
Read-only `plan` says all of it first: what is linked, copied and left out, and the disk it costs.
