"""The planet probe's user log (FO4SFPlanetProbe.0.log, written by scripts/planet/FO4SF_PlanetProbeQuest.psc) read
back into arrivals, readings and a verdict per test reference (docs/planet/planet-probe.md section 5).

Every line the script writes holds "FO4SFPP rt=<real time s> <event> key=value ...", anywhere in the line (the game
puts a time stamp in front). Values: form ids as Papyrus prints them (signed decimal, so a load index of 0x80 or more
and the runtime FF ids are negative), floats, bools, "none" for a None form, and lists of form ids joined by commas
("none" for an empty list). Events: init (once per new script instance: the quest's own id gives the probe plugin's
load index), chain (the location chain as the game resolves it), arrive, then player / planet / ref / location
lines at 2, 10, 30 and 60 s after each arrival.

The chain line (chain_reading) gives every link of our location chain more than one reading, because two things it
leans on are untested: which way IsChild reads, and GetParentLocations with no keyword. Starfield's Location.psc says
IsChild "Returns whether the other location is a child of this one" (ContentResources.zip, read 29 Oct), and
ObjectReference.IsInLocation calls it so (the parent asks), but some vanilla quest scripts call it the other way (the
child asks: MQ204_NA_StateChangeHandlerScript, UC04_QuestScript), so version 2 of the script asks it both ways
(<caller>_ischild_<argument>). It also lists the parents the game gives each of our three locations
(probe_parents, surface_parents, planet_parents: GetParentLocations with no keyword, a form no vanilla script uses),
and asks the way SQ_ParentScript finds a planet location's star system and a site's planet and star system
(planet_systems, probe_orbitals, probe_systems: with LocTypeStarSystem or LocTypeMajorOrbital). The reader looks
for each location's own parent in our records in that location's own lists, so the answer does not depend on how far
a list goes. A link is broken (a problem) only when every reading of it says so; readings that disagree are a note.
The lookups from the probe location (reach) and the way IsChild answered are notes too. Version 2 ends the line with
end=true; a line without it was cut, so its last value (perhaps a list cut short) is left out. Version 1 (probe run 1,
29 Oct) asked IsChild one way only, the child about its parent (probe_child_of_surface, surface_child_of_planet):
those two values settle nothing until a version 2 log shows which way IsChild reads, and the reader says so instead
of judging them.

Case: Starfield's Papyrus prints a bool as "true" / "false" (verified: the bridge log of 14 Oct and the new game log
of 28 Oct, docs/ai/test-queue.md and docs/newgame/vault111-start.md), Fallout 4's as "True" / "False". It also keeps
one spelling per string, so literal text can come back in another case (the 28 Oct log printed "FO4Port.esm" as
"fo4port.esm"). So the reader ignores case: in the prefix, the events, the keys, the bools, "none" and the tags
(read as upper case: T1 .. T6, MERGE, LC172COC).

The verdict a reference gets at an arrival, from its last reading there:
  with player   found, in the player's worldspace (sameworld true, the worldspace not None)
  left behind   found, in another worldspace (for ours: the base probe world the game never plays)
  not loaded    GetFormFromFile returned None: a temporary reference whose cell is not loaded, or a missing record
  not installed its plugin is not loaded
  unknown       the line lacks a value the verdict needs (a cut line), or both are in interiors
The offset is the reference's position minus its position in the plugin (plan.json "refs" / "merge"): (0, 0) is a
reference where the plugin put it; a merged reference moves with its world (LC172World's COC marker moved by about
(-500, -2300) on 11 Oct). The distance is GetDistance to the player; for a reference in another worldspace the game
returns the largest float, 3.4e38 (verified: probe run 1, 31 of 33 readings), which the table leaves out.
