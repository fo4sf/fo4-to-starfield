"""The combined core's C++ port (sfse/FOCCSim) against the Python reference (src/fo4sf/combined): the same state, the
same ticks and the same player actions give byte-identical canonical JSON after every tick
(docs/combined-core-cpp-port.md section 2, the parity contract), and the same engine adapter output (step C2: the
record plan and game view, then every tick's writes), presentation plans (C3: for a player walking the world) and
results of the player's actions (C4: settlement management and radiant jobs, refusals included; C5: the news and
its terminal page, with a fuzz test of the textwrap port). The repo's first compiled test: the portable core is
built with the C++ compiler on PATH (g++ or clang++; CI's ubuntu has g++) into a temporary folder, and the test is
skipped where there is none. FOCCSIM_EXE=<path> runs the same tests against a core built elsewhere instead (the PC's
MSVC build).

By default: the two-region fixture for seeds 0 to 9 over 90 days, its variants (raid pressure low and high, story mode
with an active story, scripted player actions) for seed 0, and the Commonwealth-scale draft for 30 days, each compared
once per game day and at the end. With FO4SF_PARITY_FULL=1: after every tick, every variant for seeds 0 to 9, and the
Commonwealth-scale draft for 90 days, as the plan asks."""
